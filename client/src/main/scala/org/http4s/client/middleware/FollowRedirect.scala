/**
  * Client middleware to follow redirect responses.
  *
  * A 301 or 302 response is followed by:
  * - a GET if the request was GET or POST
  * - a HEAD if the request was a HEAD
  * - the original request method and body if the body had no effects
  * - the redirect is not followed otherwise
  *
  * A 303 response is followed by:
  * - a HEAD if the request was a HEAD
  * - a GET for all other methods
  *
  * A 307 or 308 response is followed by:
  * - the original request method and body, if the body had no effects
  * - the redirect is not followed otherwise
  *
  * Whenever we follow with a GET or HEAD, an empty body is sent, and
  * all payload headers defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.3
  * are stripped.
  *
  * If the response does not contain a valid Location header, the redirect is
  * not followed.
