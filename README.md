Http4s is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface for HTTP services.  Http4s is
Scala's answer to Ruby's Rack, Python's WSGI, Haskell's WAI, and Java's
Servlets.

```scala
val http = HttpRoutes.of {
  case GET -> Root / "hello" =>
    Ok("Hello, better world.")
}
```

Learn more at [http4s.org](https://http4s.org/).

If you run into any difficulties please enable partial unification in your `build.sbt` (not needed for Scala 2.13 and beyond, because Scala 2.13.0+ has partial unification switched on by default)

```scala
scalacOptions ++= Seq("-Ypartial-unification")
```

## Requirements

Running the **blaze** backend requires a modern, supported version of the JVM to build and run, as it relies on server
APIs unavailable before JDK8u252. Any JDK newer than JDK8u252, including 9+ is supported.

## Code of Conduct

http4s is proud to be a [Typelevel](https://typelevel.org/)
project.  We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, and ask that the community adhere to the [Scala
Code of Conduct](https://http4s.org/code-of-conduct/).
