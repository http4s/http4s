This guide is for people who would like to be involved in building
http4s.

## Find something that belongs in http4s

Looking for a way that you can help out? Check out our [issue
tracker].  Choose a ticket that looks interesting to you.  Before you
start working on it, make sure that it's not already assigned to
someone and that nobody has left a comment saying that they are
working on it!  Of course, you can also comment on an issue someone is
already working on and offer to collaborate.

[issue tracker]: https://github.com/http4s/http4s/issues

Have an idea for something new? That's great! We recommend that you
make sure it belongs in http4s before you put effort into creating a
pull request. The preferred ways to do that are to either:

* [Create a GitHub issue] describing your idea.
* Get feedback in the [http4s Gitter room].

[Create a GitHub issue]: https://github.com/http4s/http4s/issues/new
[http4s Gitter room]: https://gitter.im/http4s/http4s

## Let us know you are working on it

If there is already a GitHub issue for the task you are working on,
leave a comment to let people know that you are working on it. If
there isn't already an issue and it is a non-trivial task, it's a good
idea to create one (and note that you're working on it). This prevents
contributors from duplicating effort.

## Build the project

First you'll need to checkout a local copy of the code base:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:http4s/http4s.git
```

To build http4s, you should have [SBT] and [Hugo] installed.  Run `sbt ci`.
This runs:

* `test`: compiles all code and runs the unit tests
* `makeSite`: compiles the tutorial, generates the scaladoc, and
  builds the static site.
* `mimaReportBinaryIssues`: checks for binary compatibility changes,
  which are relevant past patch release .0.

## Coding standard

### Formatting

The Travis CI build verifies that code is formatted correctly
according to the [Scalafmt] config and will fail if a diff is found.

You can run `validate` to test the formatting before opening a PR.  If
your PR fails due to formatting, run `;test:scalafmt`.

[Scalafmt]: http://scalameta.org/scalafmt/

### Types

#### Effects

Prefer a parameterized effect type and cats-effect type classes over
specializing on a task. (In versions before cats-effect is on the classpath,
specialize on use `fs2.Task` or `scalaz.concurrent.Task`.)

```scala
// Good
def apply[F[_]](service: HttpService[F])(implicit F: Monad[F]): HttpService[F]

// Bad
def apply(service: HttpService[Task]): HttpService[Task]
```

For examples and tutorials, use `cats.effect.IO` wherever a concrete effect is
needed.

#### Collections

Prefer standard library types such as `Option` and `List` to invariant
replacements from libraries such as Scalaz or Dogs.

When a list must not be empty, use `cats.data.NonEmptyList`.

#### `CaseInsensitiveString`

Many parts of the HTTP spec require case-insensitive semantics. Use
`org.http4s.util.CaseInsensitiveString` to represent these. This is important to
get correct matching semantics when using case class extractors.

### Case classes

#### `apply`

The `apply` method of a case class companion should be total. If this is
impossible for the product type, create a `sealed abstract class` and define
alternate constructors in the companion object. Make the implementation of the
sealed abstract class private.

Consider a macro for the `apply` method if it is partial, but literal arguments
can be validated at compile time.

#### Safe constructors

Constructors that take an alternate type `A` should be named `fromA`. This
includes constructors that return a value as a `ParseResult`.

```scala
case class Foo(seconds: Long)

object Foo {
  def fromFiniteDuration(d: FiniteDuration): Foo =
    apply(d.toSeconds)
    
  def fromString(s: String): ParseResult[Foo] =
    try s.toLong
    catch { case e: NumberFormatException => 
      new ParseFailure("not a long") 
    }
}
```

Prefer `fromString` to `parse`.

#### Unsafe constructors

All constructors that are partial on their input should be prefixed with `unsafe`.

```
// Good
def fromLong(l: Long): ParseResult[Foo] =
  if (l < 0) Left(ParseFailure("l must be non-negative"))
  else Right(new Foo(l))
def unsafeFromLong(l: Long): Foo = 
  fromLong(l).fold(throw _, identity)

// Bad
def fromLong(l: Long): ParseResult[Foo] =
  if (l < 0) throw new ParseFailure("crash boom bang")
  else Right(new Foo(l))
```

Constructors prefixed with `from` may return either a `ParseResult[A]` or, if
total, `A`.

## Attributions

If your contribution has been derived from or inspired by other work,
please state this in its scaladoc comment and provide proper
attribution.  When possible, include the original authors' names and a
link to the original work.

### Grant of license

http4s is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0]. Opening a pull
request signifies your consent to license your contributions under the
Apache License 2.0.

## Tests

* Tests for http4s-core go into the `tests` module.
* Tests should extend `Http4sSpec`.  `Http4sSpec` extends [Specs2]
  with all syntax, standard instances, and helpers for convenience.
* We use Specs2's integration with [ScalaCheck] for property testing.
  We prefer property tests where feasible, complemented by example
  tests where they increase clarity or confidence.
* We encourage the addition of arbitrary instances to
  `org.http4s.testing.Http4sArbitraries` to support richer property
  testing.

## Documentation

The documentation for http4s is divided into two projects: `website`
and `docs`

### `website`

The common area of http4s.org (i.e., directories not beginning with
`/v#.#`) is generated from the `website` module and is published only
from the `master` branch`.  This module is intended to contain general
info about the project that applies to all versions.

#### Editing the common site

All pages have an edit link at the top right for direct editing of the
markdown via GitHub.

### `docs` documentation

Each branch `master` and `release-X.Y`, publishes documentation per
minor version into the `/vX.Y` directory of http4s.org.  The Hugo site
chrome lives in the `docs/src/hugo` directory, and the [tut] content
lives in `docs/src/main/tut`.  Tut is used to typecheck our
documentation as part of the build.

#### Editing the versioned site

All pages have an edit link at the top right for direct editing of the
markdown via GitHub.  Be aware that the Travis build will fail if invalid
code is added.

## Submit a pull request

Before you open a pull request, you should make sure that `sbt ci` runs
successfully. Travis CI will run this as well, but it may save you some
time to be alerted to style or tut problems earlier.

If your pull request addresses an existing issue, please tag that
issue number in the body of your pull request or commit message. For
example, if your pull request addresses issue number 52, please
include "fixes #52".

If you make changes after you have opened your pull request, please
add them as separate commits and avoid squashing or
rebasing. Squashing and rebasing can lead to a tidier git history, but
they can also be a hassle if somebody else has done work based on your
branch.
