# v0.18.25 (2020-01-21)

## Bug fixes
* [#3093](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3093): Backport [#3086](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3086): Fix connection leak in blaze-client pool manager when the next request in the queue is expired.

# v0.21.0-RC1 (2020-01-21)

## Breaking changes

* [#3012](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3012): Use `HttpApp` instead of `HttpRoutes` in `Http4sServlet`. The servlet builders themselves retain compatibility.
* [#3078](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3078): Wrap Java exceptions in `ConnectionFailure` when a blaze-client fails to establish a connection. This preserves information about which host could not be connected to.
* [#3062](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3062): http4s' JSON support is now built on jawn-1.0.0, which is a binary break from jawn-0.14.x.  This comes with a bump to circe-0.13.  Most circe-0.13 modules are binary compatible with circe-0.12, but note that circe-parser is not.
* [#3055](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3055): Add fs2-io's TLS support to ember-client.  The `sslContext: Option[(ExecutionContext, SSLContext)]` argument is replaced by a `tlsContext: Option[TLSContext]`.`

## Enhancements

* [#3004](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3004): Add `classloader` argument to `StaticFile.fromResource` 
* [#3007](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3007): Add `classloader` argument to `TomcatBuilder`

* [#3031](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3031): Relax `Router.apply` constraint from `Sync` to `Monad`
* [#2821](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2821): Add `Media` supertype of `Message` and `Part`, so multipart parts can use `EntityDecoder`s
* [#3021](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3021): Relax `Throttle.apply` constraint from `Sync` to `Monad`. Add a `mapK` operation to `TokenBucket`.
* [#3056](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3056): Add `streamJsonArrayEncoder*` operations to circe support, to encode a `Stream` of `A` to a JSON array, given an encoder for `A`.
* [#3053](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3053): Remove unneeded `Functor[G]` constraint on `HeaderEcho.apply`.
* [#3054](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3054): Add `SameSite` cookie support
* [#2518](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2518): Add `status` methods to `Client` that take a `String` or `Uri`
* [#3069](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3069): Add `ContextMiddleware.const` function
* [#3070](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3070): Add `NonEmptyTraverse` instance to `ContextRequest`
* [#3060](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3060): Stop mixing context bounds and implicits in `CirceInstances`.
* [#3024](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3024): Add `withQueryParams` and `withMultiValueQueryParams` to `QueryOps`
* [#3092](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3092): Add TLS support to ember-server via fs2-io.

## Breaking changes

* [#2785](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2785): Use `F[A]` instead of `G[A]` in the DSL's `EntityResponseGenerator`. This change is binary compatible, but not source compatible for users of `Http4sDsl2` where `F` is not `G`. This is uncommon.

# v0.21.0-M3 (2019-08-02)

# v0.21.0-M2 (2019-07-09)

This release drops support for Scala 2.11 and adds the `http4s-ember-server` and `http4s-ember-client` backends.  Ember is new and experimental, but we intend for it to become the reference implementation.  Notably, it only requires a `Concurrent` constraint.

* [#2693](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2693): Fix deadlock in client by releasing current connection before retrying in `FollowRedirect` client middleware.  The constraint is upgraded to `Concurrent`.
* [#2671](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2671): Upgrade `Uri.UserInfo` to a case class with username and password, fixing encoding issues. This is for RFC 3986 compliance, where it's deprecated for security reasons. Please don't use this.
* [#2704](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2704): Remove unused `Sync` constraint on `Part.formData`.

## Breaking changes
* [#2654](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2654): Extract an http4s-laws module from http4s-testing, with no dependency on Specs2.  The arbitraries, laws, and tests are now laid out in a similar structure to cats and cats-effect.

* [#2661](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2661): Move string contexts macros for literals from `org.http4s` to `org.http4s.implicits`
* [#2679](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2679): Replace `Uri.IPv4` with `Uri.Ipv4Address`, including an `ipv4` interpolator and interop with `Inet4Address`.
* [#2694](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2694): Drop Scala 2.11 support 
* [#2700](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2700): Replace `Uri.IPv6` with `Uri.Ipv6Address`, including an `ipv6` interpolator and interop with `Inet6Address`.

## Announcements

### blaze-client stability

We are declaring this a stable release, though we acknowledge a handful of lingering issues with the blaze-client.  Users who have trouble with the blaze backend are invited to try the async-http-client, okhttp, or jetty-client backends instead.

### Scala 2.13 compatibility

When our dependencies are published for Scala 2.13.0-RC1, we will publish for it and drop support for Scala 2.13.0-M5.  We know it's out there, and we're as anxious as you.

### cats-2 and http4s-0.21

Cats 2.0 is expected soon, and a Cats Effect 2.0 is under discussion.  These will be binary compatible with their 1.x versions, with the exception of their laws modules.  We intend to publish http4s-0.21 on these when they are available in order to provide a compatible stack for our own laws.

### EOL of 0.18

This marks the end of active support for the 0.18 series.  Further releases in that series will require a pull request and an accompanying tale of woe.

## Breaking changes
* [#2506](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2506): Raise `DecodeFailure` with `MonadError` in `Message#as` rather than relying on effect to catch in `fold`. Requires a new `MonadError` constraint.

## Bugfixes
* [#2502](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2502): Stop relying on undefined behavior of `fold` to catch errors in client.

## Enhancements
* [#2508](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2508): Add `mediaType` String context macro for validating literals.  Provide the same for `uri` and `qValue`, deprecating `Uri.uri` and `QValue.q`.
* [#2520](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2520): Parameterize `selectorThreadFactory` for blaze server.  This allows setting the priority for selector threads.

  * Deprecate `withType`, which takes a `MediaType` and just wraps it in a `Content-Type`
  * Add `withoutAttribute` and `withoutTrailerHeaders` to complement the with variants
  * Correct `filterHeaders`' scaladoc comment, which described the opposite of the behavior
  * Fix bug in `withoutContentType`

## Enhancements
* [#2205](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2205): Add new `ResponseTiming` middleware, which adds a header to the Response as opposed to full `MetricsOps`.
* [#2222](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2222): Add `shutdownTimeout` property to `JettyBuilder`.  Shutdown of the server waits for existing connections to complete for up to this duration before a hard shutdown with a `TimeoutException`.
* [#2227](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2227): Add `withMaxHeaderLength` setter to `BlazeClientBuilder`
* [#2230](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2230): `DefaultServerErrorHandler` only handles `NonFatal` `Throwable`s, instead of all `Throwable`s that aren't `VirtualMachineError`s
* [#2237](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2237): Support parsing cookies with trailing semi-colons. This is invalid per spec, but seen often in the wild.
* [#1687](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1687): Add a modeled `Link` header.
* [#2244](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2244): Refactor blaze-server idle timeout
  * Quiet `Abnormal NIO1HeadStage termination\njava.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Timeout of 30 seconds triggered. Killing pipeline.` error logging, even on idling persistent connections.  This is reduced to a debug log.
  * Use a `TickWheelExecutor` resource per blaze-server instead of a global that does not shut down when the server does.

## Bug fixes

# v0.20.0-M1 (2018-10-27)

Due to the inadvertent release of 0.19.0, we have opened a new minor version.  The stable release with MiMa enforcement will be v0.20.0.

## Breaking changes
* [#2159](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2159): Add a `responseHeaderTimeout` property to `BlazeServerBuilder`. Responses that timeout are completed with `Response.timeout`, which defaults to 503 Service Unavailable.  `BlazeServerBuilder` now requires a `Timer[F]`.
* [#2177](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2177): Deprecate `org.http4s.syntax.async`, which was not directly relevant to HTTP.
* [#2131](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2131): Refactor server metrics
  * `http4s-server-metrics` module merged into `http4s-dropwizard-metrics`
  * `http4s-prometheus-server-metrics` module merged into `http4s-prometheus-metrics`
  * The `org.http4s.server.middleware.metrics.Metrics` middleware now takes a `MetricsOps`, implemented by Dropwizard, Prometheus, or your custom interpreter.
* [#2180](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2180): Change default response on `Timeout` middlware to `503 Service Unavailable`

## Enhancements
* [#2159](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2159): Set default client request timeout to 1 minute
* [#2163](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2163): Add `mapK` to `Request` and `Response`
* [#2168](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2168): Add `allocate` to client builders
* [#2174](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2159): Refactor the blaze-client timeout architecture.
  * A `TickWheelExecutor` is now allocated per client, instead of globally.
  * Request rendering and response parsing is now canceled more aggressively on timeout.
* [#2184](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2184): Receive response concurrently with sending request in blaze client. This reduces waste when the server is not interested in the entire request body.
* [#2190](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2190): Add `channelOptions` to blaze-client to customize socket options.

## Bug fixes
* [#2166](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2166): Fix request timeout calculation in blaze-client to resolve "Client response header timeout after 0 millseconds" error.
* [#2189](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2189): Manage the `TickWheelTimer` as a resource instead of an `F[A, F[Unit]]`. This prevents a leak in (extremely unlikely) cases of cancellation.

## Internal
* [#2179](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2179): Method to silence expected exceptions in tests
* [#2194](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2194): Remove ill-conceived, zero-timeout unit tests

## Enhancements
* [#2178](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2178): Redact sensitive headers by default in `Retry` middleware. Add `retryWithRedactedHeaders` function that parameterizes the headers predicate.

* [#2070](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2070): Give `AbitraryInstances` unique names with `http4sTesting` prefix.
* [#2136](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2136): Add `stream` method to `Client` interface. Deprecate `streaming`, which is just a `flatMap` of `Stream`.
* [#2143](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2143): WebSocket model improvements:
  * The `org.http4s.websocket` package in unified in http4s-core
  * Drop http4s-websocket module dependency
  * All frames use an immutable `scodec.bits.ByteVector` instead of an `Array[Byte]`.
  * Frames moved from `WebSocketBits` to the `WebSocketFrame` companion
  * Rename all instances of `Websocket*` to `WebSocket*` for consistency
* [#2094](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2094): Metrics unification
  * Add a `MetricsOps` algebra to http4s-core to be implemented by any metrics backend.
  * Create new `Metrics` middleware in http4s-client based on `MetricsOps`
  * Replace http4s-dropwizard-client-metrics and http4s-proemtheus-client-metrics modules with http4s-dropwizard-metrics and http4s-prometheus-metrics to implement `MetricsOps`.

# v0.19.0-M3 (2018-09-27)

## Breaking changes
* [#2081](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2081): Remove `OkHttp` code redundant with `OkHttpBuilder`.
* [#2092](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2092): Remove `ExecutionContext` and `Timer` implicits from async-http-client. Threads are managed by the `ContextShift`.
* [#2115](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2115): Refactoring of `Server` and `ServerBuilder`:
  * Removed `Server#shutdown`, `Server#shutdownNow`, `Server#onShutdown`, and `Server#awaitShutdown`.  `Server` lifecycles are managed as a `fs2.Stream` or a `cats.effect.Resource`.
  * `ServerBuilder#start` replaced by `Server#resource`, which shuts down the `Server` after use.
  * Added a `ServerBuilder#stream` to construct a `Stream` from a `Resource`.
* [#2118](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2118): Finalize various case classes.
* [#2102](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2102): Refactoring of `Client` and some builders:
  * `Client` is no longer a case class.  Construct a new `Client` backend or middleware with `Client.apply(run: Request[F] => Resource[F, Response[F]])` for any `F` with a `Bracket[Throwable, F]`.
  * Removed `DisposableResponse[F]` in favor of `Resource[F, Response[F]]`.
  * Removed `Client#open` in favor of `Client#run`.
  * Removed `Client#shutdown` in favor of `cats.effect.Resource` or `fs2.Stream`.
  * Removed `AsyncHttpClient.apply`. It was not referentially transparent, and no longer possible. Use `AsyncHttpClient.resource` instead.
  * Removed deprecated `blaze.Http1Client.apply`

## Enhancements
* [#2042](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2042): New `Throttle` server middleware

# v0.19.0-M2 (2018-09-07)

## Breaking changes
* [#1802](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1802): Race servlet requests against the `AsyncContext.timeout`. `JettyBuilder` and `TomcatBuilder` now require a `ConcurrentEffect` instance.
* [#1934](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1934): Refactoring of `ConnectionManager`.  Now requires a `Concurrent` instance, which ripples to a `ConcurrentEffect` in blaze-client builders
* [#2023](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2023): Don't overwrite existing `Vary` headers from `CORS`
* [#2030](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2023): Restrict `MethodNotAllowed` response generator in DSL
* [#2032](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2032): Eliminate mutable `Status` registry. IANA-registered `Status`es are still cached, but `register` is no longer public.
* [#2026](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2026): `CSRF` enhancements
  * CSRF tokens represented with a newtype
  * CSRF token signatures are encoded hexadecimal strings, making them URI-safe.
  * Added a `headerCheck: Request[F] => Boolean` parameter
  * Added an `onFailure: Response[F]` parameter, which defaults to a `403`. This was formerly a hardcoded `401`.
* [#1993](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2026): Massive changes from cats-effect and fs2 upgrades
  * `Timer` added to `AsyncHttpClient`
  * Dropwizard `Metrics` middleware now takes a `Clock` rather than a `Timer`
  * Client builders renamed and refactored for consistency and to support binary compatible evolution after 1.0:
    * `BlazeClientBuilder` replaces `Http1Client`, `BlazeClient`, and `BlazeClientConfig`
    * Removed deprecated `SimpleHttp1Client`
    * `JavaNetClient` renamed to `JavaNetClientBuilder`, which now has a `resource` and `stream`
    * `OkHttp` renamed to `OkHttpBuilder`.  The client now created from an `OkHttpClient` instance instead of an `F[OkHttpClient.Builder]`. A default client can be created as a `Resource` through `OkHttp.default`.
  * Fallout from removal of `fs2.Segment`
    * `EntityDecoder.collectBinary` now decodes a `Chunk`
    * `EntityDecoder.binaryChunk` deprecated
    * `SegmentWriter` is removed
    * Changes to:
      * `ChunkWriter`s in blaze rewritten
      * `Logger` middlewares
      * `MemoryCache`
  * Blocking I/O now requires a blocking `ExecutionContext` and a `ContextShift`:
    * `EntityDecoder`s:
      * `EntityDecoder.binFile`
      * `EntityDecoder.textFile`
      * `MultipartDecoder.mixedMultipart`
    * `EntityEncoder`s (no longer implicit):
      * `File`
      * `Path`
      * `InputStream`
      * `Reader`
    * Multipart:
      * `MultipartParser.parseStreamedFile`
      * `MultipartParser.parseToPartsStreamedFile`
      * `Part.fileData`
    * Static resources:
      * `StaticFile.fromString`
      * `StaticFile.fromResource`
      * `StaticFile.fromURL`
      * `StaticFile.fromFile`
      * `FileService.Config`
      * `ResourceService.Config`
      * `WebjarService.Config`
    * `OkHttpBuilder`
    * Servlets:
      * `BlockingHttp4sServlet`
      * `BlockingServletIo`
  * Servlet backend changes:
    * `Http4sServlet` no longer shift onto an `ExecutionContext` by default.  Accordingly, `ServerBuilder` no longer has a `withExecutionContext`.
    * Jetty and Tomcat builders use their native executor types instead of shifting onto an `ExecutionContext`.  Accordingly, `ServletBuilder#withExecutionContext` is removed.
    * `AsyncHttp4sServlet` and `ServletContextSyntax` now default to non-blocking I/O.  No startup check is made against the servlet version, which failed classloading on an older servlet container.  Neither takes an `ExeuctionContext` parameter anymore.
  * Removed deprecated `StreamApp` aliases. `fs2.StreamApp` is removed and replaced by `cats.effect.IOApp`, `monix.eval.TaskApp`, or similar.
  * Removed deprecated `ServerApp`.
  * `EntityLimiter` middleware now requires an `ApplicativeError`
* [#2054](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2054): blaze-server builder changes
  * `BlazeBuilder` deprecated for `BlazeServerBuilder`
  * `BlazeServerBuidler` has a single `withHttpApp(HttpApp)` in place of zero-to-many calls `mountService(HttpRoutes)`.
    * This change makes it possible to mount an `HttpApp` wrapped in a `Logger` middleware, which only supports `HttpApp`
    * Call `.orNotFound`, from `org.http4s.implicits._`, to cap an `HttpRoutes` as `HttpApp`
    * Use `Router` to combine multiple `HttpRoutes` into a single `HttpRoutes` by prefix
    * This interface will see more changes before 0.19.0 to promote long-term binary compatibility

  * jetty-9.4.8.v20171121
  * log4s-1.4.0
  * scalaz-7.2.17
  * twirl-1.3.13

# v0.18.0-M5 (2017-11-02)
* Introduced an `HttpCodec` type class that represents a type that can round
  trip to and from a `String`.  `Uri.Scheme` and `TransferCoding` are the first
  implementors, with more to follow.  Added an `HttpCodecLaws` to http4s-testing.
* `Uri.Scheme` is now its own type instead of a type alias.
* `TransferCoding` is no longer a case class. Its `coding` member is now a
  `String`, not a `CaseInsensitiveString`. Its companion is no longer a
  `Registry`.
* Introduced `org.http4s.syntax.literals`, which contains a `StringContext` forAll
  safely constructing a `Uri.Scheme`.  More will follow.
* `org.http4s.util.StreamApp.ExitCode` moved to `org.http4s.util.ExitCode`
* Changed `AuthService[F[_], T]` to `AuthService[T, F[_]]` to support
  partial unification when combining services as a `SemigroupK`.
* Unseal the `MessageFailure` hierarchy. Previous versions of http4s had a
  `GenericParsingFailure`, `GenericDecodeFailure`, and
  `GenericMessageBodyFailure`. This was not compatible with the parameterized
  effect introduced in v0.18. Now, `MessageFailure` is unsealed, so users
  wanting precise control over the default `toHttpResponse` can implement their
  own failure conditions.
* `MessageFailure` now has an `Option[Throwable]` cause.
* Removed `KleisliInstances`. The `SemigroupK[Kleisli[F, A, ?]]` is now provided
  by cats.  Users should no longer need to import `org.http4s.implicits._` to
  get `<+>` composition of `HttpService`s
* `NonEmptyList` extensions moved from `org.http4s.util.nonEmptyList` to
  `org.http4s.syntax.nonEmptyList`.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * cats-1.0.0-RC1
  * fs2-0.10.0-M8
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.5

# v0.18.0-M4 (2017-10-12)
* Syntax for building requests moved from `org.http4s.client._` to
  `org.http4s.client.dsl.Http4sClientDsl[F]`, with concrete type `IO`
  available as `org.http4s.client.dsl.io._`.  This is consistent with
  http4s-dsl for servers.
* Change `StreamApp` to return a `Stream[F, ExitCode]`. The first exit code
  returned by the stream is the exit code of the JVM. This allows custom exit
  codes, and eases dead code warnings in certain constructions that involved
  mapping over `Nothing`.
* `AuthMiddleware.apply` now takes an `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], T]`
  instead of a `Kleisli[F, Request[F], T]`.
* Set `Content-Type` header on default `NotFound` response.
* Merges from v0.16.5 and v0.17.5.
* Remove mutable map that backs `Method` registry. All methods in the IANA
  registry are available through `Method.all`. Custom methods should be memoized
  by other means.
* Adds an `EntityDecoder[F, Array[Byte]]` and `EntityDecoder[F, Array[Char]]`
  for symmetry with provided `EntityEncoder` instances.
* Adds `Arbitrary` instances for `Headers`, `EntityBody[F]` (currently just
  single chunk), `Entity[F]`, and `EntityEncoder[F, A]`.
* Adds `EntityEncoderLaws` for `EntityEncoder`.
* Adds `EntityCodecLaws`.  "EntityCodec" is not a type in http4s, but these
  laws relate an `EntityEncoder[F, A]` to an `EntityDecoder[F, A]`.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.5 (2017-10-12)
* Merges only.

# v0.16.5 (2017-10-11)
* Correctly implement sanitization of dot segments in static file paths
  according to RFC 3986 5.2.4. Most importantly, this fixes an issue where `...`
  is reinterpreted as `..` and can escape the root of the static file service.

# v0.18.0-M3 (2017-10-04)
* Merges only.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.4 (2017-10-04)
* Fix reading of request body in non-blocking servlet backend. It was previously
  only reading the first byte of each chunk.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.1.1

# v0.16.4 (2017-10-04)
* Backport removal `java.xml.bind` dependency from `GZip` middleware,
  to play more nicely with Java 9.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * metrics-core-3.2.5
  * tomcat-8.0.23
  * twirl-1.3.12

# v0.18.0-M2 (2017-10-03)
* Use http4s-dsl with any effect type by either:
    * extend `Http4sDsl[F]`
    * create an object that extends `Http4sDsl[F]`, and extend that.
    * `import org.http4s.dsl.io._` is still available for those who
      wish to specialize on `cats.effect.IO`
* Remove `Semigroup[F[MaybeResponse[F]]]` constraint from
  `BlazeBuilder`.
* Fix `AutoSlash` middleware when a service is mounted with a prefix.
* Publish internal http4s-parboiled2 as a separate module.  This does
  not add any new third-party dependencies, but unbreaks `sbt
  publishLocal`.
* Add `Request.from`, which respects `X-Fowarded-For` header.
* Make `F` in `EffectMessageSyntax` invariant
* Add `message.decodeJson[A]` syntax to replace awkward `message.as(implicitly,
  jsonOf[A])`. Brought into scope by importing one of the following, based on
  your JSON library of choice.
  * `import org.http4s.argonaut._`
  * `import org.http4s.circe._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.jackson._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.native._`
* `AsyncHttpClient.apply` no longer takes a `bufferSize`.  It is made
  irrelevant by fs2-reactive-streams.
* `MultipartParser.parse` no longer takes a `headerLimit`, which was unused.
* Add `maxWaitQueueLimit` (default 256) and `maxConnectionsPerRequestKey`
  (default 10) to `PooledHttp1Client`.
* Remove private implicit `ExecutionContext` from `StreamApp`. This had been
  known to cause diverging implicit resolution that was hard to debug.
* Shift execution of the routing of the `HttpService` to the `ExecutionContext`
  provided by the `JettyBuilder` or `TomcatBuilder`. Previously, it only shifted
  the response task and stream. This was a regression from v0.16.
* Add two utility execution contexts. These may be used to increase throughput
  as the server builder's `ExecutionContext`. Blocking calls on routing may
  decrease fairness or even deadlock your service, so use at your own risk:
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.direct`
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.trampoline`
* Deprecate `EffectRequestSyntax` and `EffectResponseSyntax`. These were
  previously used to provide methods such as `.putHeaders` and `.withBody`
  on types `F[Request]` and `F[Response]`.  As an alternative:
  * Call `.map` or `.flatMap` on `F[Request]` and `F[Response]` to get access
    to all the same methods.
  * Variadic headers have been added to all the status code generators in
    `Http4sDsl[F]` and method generators in `import org.http4s.client._`.
    For example:
    * `POST(uri, urlForm, Header("Authorization", "Bearer s3cr3t"))`
    * ``Ok("This will have an html content type!", `Content-Type`(`text/html`))``
* Restate `HttpService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], Response[F]]`.
* Similarly, `AuthedService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], AuthedRequest[F], Response[F]]`.
* `MaybeResponse` is removed, because the optionality is now expressed through
  the `OptionT` in `HttpService`. Instead of composing `HttpService` via a
  `Semigroup`, compose via a `SemigroupK`. Import `org.http4s.implicits._` to
  get a `SemigroupK[HttpService]`, and chain services as `s1 <+> s2`. We hope to
  remove the need for `org.http4s.implicits._` in a future version of cats with
  [issue 1428](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1428).
* The `Service` type alias is deprecated in favor of `Kleisli`.  It used to represent
  a partial application of the first type parameter, but since version 0.18, it is
  identical to `Kleisli.
* `HttpService.lift`, `AuthedService.lift` are deprecated in favor of `Kleisli.apply`.
* Remove `java.xml.bind` dependency from `GZip` middleware to avoid an
  extra module dependency in Java 9.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M2
    * log4s-1.4.0
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.3 (2017-10-02)
* Shift execution of HttpService to the `ExecutionContext` provided by the
  `BlazeBuilder` when using HTTP/2. Previously, it only shifted the response
  task and body stream.

# v0.16.3 (2017-09-29)
* Fix `java.io.IOException: An invalid argument was supplied` on blaze-client
  for Windows when writing an empty sequence of `ByteBuffer`s.
* Set encoding of `captureWriter` to UTF-8 instead of the platform default.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * blaze-0.12.9

# v0.17.2 (2017-09-25)
* Remove private implicit strategy from `StreamApp`. This had been known to
  cause diverging implicit resolution that was hard to debug.
* Shift execution of HttpService to the `ExecutionContext` provided by the
  `BlazeBuilder`. Previously, it only shifted the response stream. This was a
  regression from 0.16.
* Split off http4s-parboiled2 module as `"org.http4s" %% "parboiled"`. There are
  no externally visible changes, but this simplifies and speeds the http4s
  build.

# v0.16.2 (2017-09-25)
* Dependency patch upgrades:
  * async-http-client-2.0.37
  * blaze-0.12.8: changes default number of selector threads to
    from `2 * cores + 1` to `max(4, cores + 1)`.
  * jetty-9.4.7.v20170914
  * tomcat-8.5.21
  * twirl-1.3.7

# v0.17.1 (2017-09-17)
* Fix bug where metrics were not captured in `Metrics` middleware.
* Pass `redactHeadersWhen` argument from `Logger` to `RequestLogger`
  and `ResponseLogger`.

# v0.16.1 (2017-09-17)
* Publish our fork of parboiled2 as http4s-parboiled2 module.  It's
  the exact same internal code as was in http4s-core, with no external
  dependencies. By publishing an extra module, we enable a
  `publishLocal` workflow.
* Charset fixes:
  * Deprecate `CharsetRange.isSatisfiedBy` in favor of
    and ```Accept-Charset`.isSatisfiedBy`` in favor of
    ```Accept-Charset`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    ```Charset`.*``.
  * Add `CharsetRange.matches`.
* ContentCoding fixes:
  * Deprecate `ContentCoding.satisfiedBy` and
    `ContentCoding.satisfies` in favor of ```Accept-Encoding`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Deprecate ```Accept-Encoding`.preferred``, which has no reasonable
    interpretation in the presence of splats.
  * Add ```Accept-Language`.qValue``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    `ContentCoding.*`.
  * Add `ContentCoding.matches` and `ContentCoding.registered`.
  * Add `Arbitrary[ContentCoding]` and ```Arbitrary[`Accept-Encoding`]``
    instances.
* LanguageTag fixes:
  * Deprecate `LanguageTag.satisfiedBy` and
    `LanguageTag.satisfies` in favor of ```Accept-Language`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    `LanguageTag.*` and matches of a partial set of subtags.
  * Add `LanguageTag.matches`.
  * Deprecate `LanguageTag.withQuality` in favor of new
    `LanguageTag.withQValue`.
  * Deprecate ```Accept-Language`.preferred``, which has no reasonable
    interpretation in the presence of splats.
  * Add ```Accept-Language`.qValue``.
  * Add `Arbitrary[LanguageTag]` and ```Arbitrary[`Accept-Language`]``
    instances.

# v0.17.0 (2017-09-01)
* Honor `Retry-After` header in `Retry` middleware.  The response will
  not be retried until the maximum of the backoff strategy and any
  time specified by the `Retry-After` header of the response.
* The `RetryPolicy.defaultRetriable` only works for methods guaranteed
  to not have a body.  In fs2, we can't introspect the stream to
  guarantee that it can be rerun.  To retry requests for idempotent
  request methods, use `RetryPolicy.unsafeRetriable`.  To retry
  requests regardless of method, use
  `RetryPolicy.recklesslyRetriable`.
* Fix `Logger` middleware to render JSON bodies as text, not as a hex
  dump.
* `MultipartParser.parse` returns a stream of `ByteVector` instead of
  a stream of `Byte`. This perserves chunking when parsing into the
  high-level `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`, and substantially improves
  performance on large files.  The high-level API is not affected.

# v0.16.0 (2017-09-01)
* `Retry` middleware takes a `RetryPolicy` instead of a backoff
  strategy.  A `RetryPolicy` is a function of the request, the
  response, and the number of attempts.  Wrap the previous `backoff`
  in `RetryPolicy {}` for compatible behavior.
* Expose a `Part.fileData` constructor that accepts an `EntityBody`.

# v0.17.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* In blaze-server, when doing chunked transfer encoding, flush the
  header as soon as it is available.  It previously buffered until the
  first chunk was available.

# v0.16.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* Add a `responseHeaderTimeout` property to `BlazeClientConfig`.  This
  measures the time between the completion of writing the request body
  to the reception of a complete response header.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.35

# v0.18.0-M1 (2017-08-24)

This release is the product of a long period of parallel development
across different foundation libraries, making a detailed changelog
difficult.  This is a living document, so if any important points are
missed here, please send a PR.

The most important change in http4s-0.18 is that the effect type is
parameterized.  Where previous versions were specialized on
`scalaz.concurrent.Task` or `fs2.Task`, this version supports anything
with a `cats.effect.Effect` instance.  The easiest way to port an
existing service is to replace your `Task` with `cats.effect.IO`,
which has a similar API and is already available on your classpath.
If you prefer to bring your own effect, such as `monix.eval.Task` or
stick to `scalaz.concurrent.Task` or put a transformer on `IO`, that's
fine, too!

The parameterization chanages many core signatures throughout http4s:
- `Request` and `Response` become `Request[F[_]]` and
  `Response[F[_]]`.  The `F` is the effect type of the body (i.e.,
  `Stream[F, Byte]`), or what the body `.run`s to.
- `HttpService` becomes `HttpService[F[_]]`, so that the service
  returns an `F[Response[F]]`.  Instead of constructing with
  `HttpService { ... }`, we now declare the effect type of the
  service, like `HttpService[IO] { ... }`.  This determines the type
  of request and response handled by the service.
- `EntityEncoder[A]` and `EntityDecoder[A]` are now
  `EntityEncoder[F[_], A]` and `EntityDecoder[F[_], A]`, respectively.
  These act as a codec for `Request[F]` and `Response[F]`.  In practice,
  this change tends to be transparent in the DSL.
- The server builders now take an `F` parameter, which needs to match
  the services mounted to them.
- The client now takes an `F` parameter, which determines the requests
  and responses it handles.

Several dependencies are upgraded:
- cats-1.0.0.MF
- circe-0.9.0-M1
- fs2-0.10.0-M6
- fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.2
- jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M1

# v0.17.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Remove `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound(a: A): Task[Response]` in favor of
  `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound: Service[Request, Response]`

# v0.16.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Move http4s-blaze-core from `org.http4s.blaze` to
  `org.http4s.blazecore` to avoid a conflict with the non-http4s
  blaze-core module.
* Change `ServiceOps` to operate on a `Service[?, MaybeResponse]`.
  Give it an `orNotFound` that returns a `Service`.  The
  `orNotFound(a: A)` overload is left for compatibility with Scala
  2.10.
* Build with Lightbend compiler instead of Typelevel compiler so we
  don't expose `org.typelevel` dependencies that are incompatible with
  ntheir counterparts in `org.scala-lang`.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * blaze-0.12.7 (fixes eviction notice in http4s-websocket)
    * twirl-1.3.4

# v0.17.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Port `ChunkAggregator` to fs2
* Add logging middleware
* Standardize on `ExecutionContext` over `Strategy` and `ExecutorService`
* Implement `Age` header
* Fix `Client#toHttpService` to not dispose until the body is consumed
* Add a buffered implementation of `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`
* In async-http-client, don't use `ReactiveStreamsBodyGenerator` unless there is
  a body to transmit. This fixes an `IllegalStateException: unexpected message
  type`
* Add `HSTS` middleware
* Add option to serve pre-gzipped resources
* Add RequestLogging and ResponseLogging middlewares
* `StaticFile` options return `OptionT[Task, ?]`
* Set `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header when serving
  from a URL
* Explicitly close `URLConnection``s if we are not reading the contents
* Upgrade to:
    * async-http-client-2.0.34
    * fs2-0.9.7
    * metrics-core-3.2.4
    * scodec-bits-1.1.5

# v0.16.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Remove laziness from `ArbitraryInstances`
* Support an arbitrary predicate for CORS allowed origins
* Support `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header for CORS
* Fix thread safety issue in `EntityDecoder[XML]`
* Support IPV6 headers in `X-Forwarded-For`
* Add `status` and `successful` methods to client
* Overload `client.fetchAs` and `client.streaming` to accept a `Task[Request]`
* Replace `Instant` with `HttpDate` to avoid silent truncation and constrain
  to dates that are legally renderable in HTTP.
* Fix bug in hash code of `CaseInsensitiveString`
* Update `request.pathInfo` when changing `request.withUri`. To keep these
  values in sync, `request.copy` has been deprecated, but copy constructors
  based on `with` have been added.
* Remove `name` from `AttributeKey`.
* Add `withFragment` and `withoutFragment` to `Uri`
* Construct `Content-Length` with `fromLong` to ensure validity, and
  `unsafeFromLong` when you can assert that it's positive.
* Add missing instances to `QueryParamDecoder` and `QueryParamEncoder`.
* Add `response.cookies` method to get a list of cookies from `Set-Cookie`
  header.  `Set-Cookie` is no longer a `Header.Extractable`, as it does
  not adhere to the HTTP spec of being concatenable by commas without
  changing semantics.
* Make servlet `HttpSession` available as a request attribute in servlet
  backends
* Fix `Part.name` to return the name from the `Content-Disposition` header
  instead of the name _of_ the `Content-Disposition` header. Accordingly, it is
  no longer a `CaseInsensitiveString`
* `Request.toString` and `Response.toString` now redact sensitive headers. A
  method to redact arbitrary headers is added to `Headers`.
* `Retry-After` is now modeled as a `Either[HttpDate, Long]` to reflect either
  an http-date or delta-seconds value.
* Look for index.html in `StaticFile` when rendering a directory instead of
  returning `401 Unauthorized`.
* Limit dates to a minimum of January 1, 1900, per RFC.
* Add `serviceErrorHandler` to `ServerBuilder` to allow pluggable error handlers
  when a server backend receives a failed task or a thrown Exception when
  invoking a service. The default calls `toHttpResponse` on `MessageFailure` and
  closes the connection with a `500 InternalServerError` on other non-fatal
  errors.  Fatal errors are left to the server.
* `FollowRedirect` does not propagate sensitive headers when redirecting to a
  different authority.
* Add Content-Length header to empty response generators
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.34
    * http4s-websocket-0.2.0
    * jetty-9.4.6.v20170531
    * json4s-3.5.3
    * log4s-1.3.6
    * metrics-core-3.2.3
    * scala-2.12.3-bin-typelevel-4
    * scalaz-7.2.15
    * tomcat-8.5.20

# v0.15.16 (2017-07-20)
* Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`

# ~~v0.15.15 (2017-07-20)~~
* Oops. Same as v0.15.14.

# v0.15.14 (2017-07-10)
* Close parens in `Request.toString`
* Use "message" instead of "request" in message body failure messages
* Add `problem+json` media type
* Tolerate `[` and `]` in queries parsing URIs. These characters are parsed, but
  percent-encoded.

# v0.17.0-M3 (2017-05-27)
* Fix file corruption issue when serving static files from the classpath

# v0.16.0-M3 (2017-05-25)
* Fix `WebjarService` so it matches assets.
* `ServerApp` overrides `process` to leave a single abstract method
* Add gzip trailer in `GZip` middleware
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * circe-0.8.0
    * jetty-9.4.5.v20170502
    * scalaz-7.2.13
    * tomcat-8.5.15
* `ProcessApp` uses a `Process[Task, Nothing]` rather than a
  `Process[Task, Unit]`
* `Credentials` is split into `Credentials.AuthParams` for key-value pairs and
  `Credentials.Token` for legacy token-based schemes.  `OAuthBearerToken` is
  subsumed by `Credentials.Token`.  `BasicCredentials` no longer extends
  `Credentials`, but is extractable from one.  This model permits the
  definition of other arbitrary credential schemes.
* Add `fromSeq` constructor to `UrlForm`
* Allow `WebjarService` to pass on methods other than `GET`.  It previously
  threw a `MatchError`.

# v0.15.13 (2017-05-25)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.32
    * blaze-0.12.6 (fixes infinite loop in some SSL handshakes)
    * jetty-9.3.19.v20170502
    * json4s-3.5.2
    * tomcat-8.0.44

# v0.15.12 (2017-05-11)
* Fix GZip middleware to render a correct stream

# v0.17.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* `Timeout` middleware takes an implicit `Scheduler` and
  `ExecutionContext`
* Bring back `http4s-async-client`, based on `fs2-reactive-stream`
* Restore support for WebSockets

# v0.16.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * argonaut-6.2
    * jetty-9.4.4.v20170414
    * tomcat-8.5.14
* Fix `ProcessApp` to terminate on process errors
* Set `secure` request attribute correctly in blaze server
* Exit with code `-1` when `ProcessApp` fails
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Rename `ProcessApp.main` to `ProcessApp.process` to avoid overload confusio
* Avoid intermediate String allocation in Circe's `jsonEncoder`
* Adaptive EntityDecoder[Json] for circe: works directly from a ByteBuffer for
  small bodies, and incrementally through jawn for larger.
* Capture more context in detail message of parse errors

# v0.15.11 (2017-04-29)
* Upgrade to blaze-0.12.5 to pick up fix for `StackOverflowError` in
  SSL handshake

# v0.15.10 (2017-04-28)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies
* argonaut-6.2
* scalaz-7.2.12
* Allow preambles and epilogues in multipart bodies
* Limit multipart headers to 40 kilobytes to avoid unbounded buffering
  of long lines in a header
* Remove `' '` and `'?'` from alphabet for generated multipart
  boundaries, as these are not token characters and are known to cause
  trouble for some multipart implementations
* Fix multipart parsing for unlucky input chunk sizes

# v0.15.9 (2017-04-19)
* Terminate `ServerApp` even if the server fails to start
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
* async-http-client-2.0.31
* jetty-9.3.18.v20170406
* json4s-3.5.1
* log4s-1.3.4
* metrics-core-3.1.4
* scalacheck-1.13.5
* scalaz-7.1.13 or scalaz-7.2.11
* tomcat-8.0.43

# v0.17.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* First release on cats and fs2
    * All scalaz types and typeclasses replaced by cats equivalengts
	* `scalaz.concurrent.Task` replaced by `fs2.Task`
	* `scalaz.stream.Process` replaced by `fs2.Stream`
* Roughly at feature parity with v0.16.0-M1. Notable exceptions:
	* Multipart not yet supported
	* Web sockets not yet supported
	* Client retry middleware can't check idempotence of requests
	* Utilties in `org.http4s.util.io` not yet ported

# v0.16.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* Fix type of `AuthedService.empty`
* Eliminate `Fallthrough` typeclass.  An `HttpService` now returns
  `MaybeResponse`, which can be a `Response` or `Pass`.  There is a
  `Semigroup[MaybeResponse]` instance that allows `HttpService`s to be
  chained as a semigroup.  `service orElse anotherService` is
  deprecated in favor of `service |+| anotherService`.
* Support configuring blaze and Jetty servers with a custom
  `SSLContext`.
