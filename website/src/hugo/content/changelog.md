Maintenance branches are merged before each new release. This change log is
ordered chronologically, so each release contains all changes described below
it.

# v0.18.11
* Prevent zero-padding of servlet input chunks [#1835](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1835)
* Fix deadlock in client loggers.  `RequestLogger.apply` and `ResponseLogger.apply` are each replaced by `apply0` to maintain binary compatibility. [#1837](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1837)
* New `http4s-boopickle` module supports entity codecs through `boopickle.Pickler` [#1826](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1826)
* Log as much of the response as is consumed in the client. Previously, failure to consume the entire body prevented any part of the body from being logged. [#1846](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1846)
* Dependency upgrades:
  * prometheus-client-java-0.4.0

# v0.18.10 (2018-05-03)
* Eliminate dependency on Macro Paradise and macro-compat [#1816](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1816)
* Add `Logging` middleware for client [#1820](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1820)
* Make blaze-client tick wheel executor lazy [#1822](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1822)

  * cats-effect-0.10.1
  * fs2-0.10.4
  * specs2-4.1.0

# v0.18.9 (2018-04-17)
* Log any exceptions when writing the header in blaze-server for HTTP/1 [#1781](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1781)
* Drain the response body (thus running its finalizer) when there is an error writing a servlet header or body [#1782](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1782)
* Clean up logging of errors thrown by services. Prevents the possible swallowing of errors thrown during `renderResponse` in blaze-server and `Http4sServlet` [#1783](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1783)
* Fix `Uri.Scheme` parser for schemes beginning with `http` other than `https` [#1790](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1790)
* Fix blaze-client to reset the connection start time on each invocation of the `F[DisposableResponse]`. This fixes the "timeout after 0 milliseconds" error. [#1792](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1792)
* Depdency upgrades:
  * blaze-0.12.13
  * http4s-websocket-0.2.1
  * specs2-4.0.4
  * tomcat-9.0.7

# v0.18.8 (2018-04-11)
* Improved ScalaDoc for BlazeBuilder [#1775](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1775)
* Added a stream constructor for async-http-client [#1776](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1776)
* http4s-prometheus-server-metrics project created. Prometheus Metrics middleware implemented for metrics on http4s server. Exposes an HttpService ready to be scraped by Prometheus, as well pairing to a CollectorRegistry for custom metric registration. [#1778](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1778)

# v0.18.7 (2018-04-04)
* Multipart parser defaults to fields interpreted as utf-8. [#1767](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1767)

# v0.18.6 (2018-04-03)
* Fix parsing of multipart bodies across chunk boundaries. [#1764](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1764)

# v0.18.5 (2018-03-28)
* Add `&` extractor to http4s-dsl. [#1758](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1758)
* Deprecate `EntityEncoder[F, Future[A]]`.  The `EntityEncoder` is strict in its argument, which causes any side effect of the `Future` to execute immediately.  Wrap your `future` in `IO.fromFuture(IO(future))` instead. [#1759](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1759)
* Dependency upgrades:
  * circe-0.9.3

# v0.18.4 (2018-03-23)

   * cats-1.0.1
   * cats-effect-0.8

# v0.18.0-M7 (2017-12-23)
* Relax various typeclass constraints from `Effect` to `Sync` or `Async`. [#1587](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1587)
* Operate on `Segment` instead of `Chunk` [#1588](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1588)
   * `EntityDecoder.collectBinary` and `EntityDecoder.binary` now
     return `Segment[Byte, Unit]` instead of `Chunk[Byte]`.  
   * Add `EntityDecoder.binaryChunk`.
   * Add `EntityEncoder.segmentEncoder`.
   * `http4sMonoidForChunk` replaced by `http4sMonoidForSegment`.
* Add new generators for core RFC 2616 types. [#1593](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1593)
* Undo obsolete copying of bytes in `StaticFile.fromURL`. [#1202](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1202)
* Optimize conversion of `Chunk.Bytes` and `ByteVectorChunk` to `ByteBuffer. [#1602](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1602)
* Rename `read` to `send` and `write` to `receive` in websocket model. [#1603](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1603)
* Remove `MediaRange` mutable `Registry` and add `HttpCodec[MediaRange]` instance [#1597](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1597)
* Remove `Monoid[Segment[A, Unit]]` instance, which is now provided by fs2. [#1609](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1609)
* Introduce `WebSocketBuilder` to build `WebSocket` responses.  Allows headers (e.g., `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`) on a successful handshake, as well as customization of the response to failed handshakes. [#1607](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1607)
* Don't catch exceptions thrown by `EntityDecoder.decodeBy`. Complain loudly in logs about exceptions thrown by `HttpService` rather than raised in `F`. [#1592](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1592)
* Make `abnormal-terminations` and `service-errors` Metrics names plural. [#1611](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1611)
* Refactor blaze client creation. [#1523](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1523)
   * `Http1Client.apply` returns `F[Client[F]]`
   * `Http1Client.stream` returns `Stream[F, Client[F]]`, bracketed to shut down the client.
   * `PooledHttp1Client` constructor is deprecated, replaced by the above.
   * `SimpleHttp1Client` is deprecated with no direct equivalent.  Use `Http1Client`.
* Improve client timeout and wait queue handling
   * `requestTimeout` and `responseHeadersTimeout` begin from the submission of the request.  This includes time spent in the wait queue of the pool. [#1570](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1570)
   * When a connection is `invalidate`d, try to unblock a waiting request under the same key.  Previously, the wait queue would only be checked on recycled connections.
   * When the connection pool is closed, allow connections in the wait queue to complete.
* Changes to Metrics middleware. [#1612](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1612)
   * Decrement the active requests gauge when no request matches
   * Don't count non-matching requests as 4xx in case they're composed with other services.
   * Don't count failed requests as 5xx in case they're recovered elsewhere.  They still get recorded as `service-error`s.
* Dependency upgrades:
   * async-http-client-2.0.38
   * cats-1.0.0.RC2
   * circe-0.9.0-M3
   * fs2-0.10.0-M10
   * fs2-jawn-0.12.0-M5
   * fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.7
   * scala-2.10.7 and scala-2.11.12

# v0.18.0-M6 (2017-12-08)
* Tested on Java 9.
* `Message.withContentType` now takes a `Content-Type` instead of an
  ``Option[`Content-Type`]``.  `withContentTypeOption` takes an `Option`,
  and `withoutContentType` clears it.
* `QValue` has an `HttpCodec` instance
* `AuthMiddleware` never falls through.  See
  [#1530](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1530) for more.
* `ContentCoding` is no longer a `Registry`, but has an `HttpCodec`
  instance.
* Render a banner on server startup.  Customize by calling
  `withBanner(List[String])` or `withoutBanner` on the
  `ServerBuilder`.
* Parameterize `isZippable` as a predicate of the `Response` in `GZip`
  middleware.
* Add constant for `application/vnd.api+json` MediaType.
* Limit memory consumption in `GZip` middleware
* Add `handleError`, `handleErrorWith`, `bimap`, `biflatMap`,
  `transform`, and `transformWith` to `EntityDecoder`.
* `org.http4s.util.StreamApp` and `org.http4s.util.ExitCode` are
  deprecated in favor of `fs2.StreamApp` and `fs2.StreamApp.ExitCode`,
  based on what was in http4s.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * fs2-0.10.0-M9
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.6
  * jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M4
  * specs2-4.0.2

# v0.17.6 (2017-12-05)
* Fix `StaticFile` to serve files larger than `Int.MaxValue` bytes
* Dependency upgrades:
  * tomcat-8.5.24

# v0.16.6 (2017-12-04)
* Add a CSRF server middleware
* Fix `NullPointerException` when starting a Tomcat server related to `docBase`
* Log version info and server address on server startup
* Dependency upgrades:
  * jetty-9.4.8.v20171121
  * log4s-1.4.0
  * scalaz-7.2.17
  * twirl-1.3.13

# v0.18.0-M5 (2017-11-02)
* Introduced an `HttpCodec` type class that represents a type that can round
  trip to and from a `String`.  `Uri.Scheme` and `TransferCoding` are the first
  implementors, with more to follow.  Added an `HttpCodecLaws` to http4s-testing.
* `Uri.Scheme` is now its own type instead of a type alias.
* `TransferCoding` is no longer a case class. Its `coding` member is now a
  `String`, not a `CaseInsensitiveString`. Its companion is no longer a
  `Registry`.
* Introduced `org.http4s.syntax.literals`, which contains a `StringContext` forAll
  safely constructing a `Uri.Scheme`.  More will follow.
* `org.http4s.util.StreamApp.ExitCode` moved to `org.http4s.util.ExitCode`
* Changed `AuthService[F[_], T]` to `AuthService[T, F[_]]` to support
  partial unification when combining services as a `SemigroupK`.
* Unseal the `MessageFailure` hierarchy. Previous versions of http4s had a
  `GenericParsingFailure`, `GenericDecodeFailure`, and
  `GenericMessageBodyFailure`. This was not compatible with the parameterized
  effect introduced in v0.18. Now, `MessageFailure` is unsealed, so users
  wanting precise control over the default `toHttpResponse` can implement their
  own failure conditions.
* `MessageFailure` now has an `Option[Throwable]` cause.
* Removed `KleisliInstances`. The `SemigroupK[Kleisli[F, A, ?]]` is now provided
  by cats.  Users should no longer need to import `org.http4s.implicits._` to
  get `<+>` composition of `HttpService`s
* `NonEmptyList` extensions moved from `org.http4s.util.nonEmptyList` to
  `org.http4s.syntax.nonEmptyList`.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * cats-1.0.0-RC1
  * fs2-0.10.0-M8
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.5

# v0.18.0-M4 (2017-10-12)
* Syntax for building requests moved from `org.http4s.client._` to
  `org.http4s.client.dsl.Http4sClientDsl[F]`, with concrete type `IO`
  available as `org.http4s.client.dsl.io._`.  This is consistent with
  http4s-dsl for servers.
* Change `StreamApp` to return a `Stream[F, ExitCode]`. The first exit code
  returned by the stream is the exit code of the JVM. This allows custom exit
  codes, and eases dead code warnings in certain constructions that involved
  mapping over `Nothing`.
* `AuthMiddleware.apply` now takes an `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], T]`
  instead of a `Kleisli[F, Request[F], T]`.
* Set `Content-Type` header on default `NotFound` response.
* Merges from v0.16.5 and v0.17.5.
* Remove mutable map that backs `Method` registry. All methods in the IANA
  registry are available through `Method.all`. Custom methods should be memoized
  by other means.
* Adds an `EntityDecoder[F, Array[Byte]]` and `EntityDecoder[F, Array[Char]]`
  for symmetry with provided `EntityEncoder` instances.
* Adds `Arbitrary` instances for `Headers`, `EntityBody[F]` (currently just
  single chunk), `Entity[F]`, and `EntityEncoder[F, A]`.
* Adds `EntityEncoderLaws` for `EntityEncoder`.
* Adds `EntityCodecLaws`.  "EntityCodec" is not a type in http4s, but these
  laws relate an `EntityEncoder[F, A]` to an `EntityDecoder[F, A]`.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.5 (2017-10-12)
* Merges only.

# v0.16.5 (2017-10-11)
* Correctly implement sanitization of dot segments in static file paths
  according to RFC 3986 5.2.4. Most importantly, this fixes an issue where `...`
  is reinterpreted as `..` and can escape the root of the static file service.

# v0.18.0-M3 (2017-10-04)
* Merges only.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.4 (2017-10-04)
* Fix reading of request body in non-blocking servlet backend. It was previously
  only reading the first byte of each chunk.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.1.1

# v0.16.4 (2017-10-04)
* Backport removal `java.xml.bind` dependency from `GZip` middleware,
  to play more nicely with Java 9.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * metrics-core-3.2.5
  * tomcat-8.0.23
  * twirl-1.3.12

# v0.18.0-M2 (2017-10-03)
* Use http4s-dsl with any effect type by either:
    * extend `Http4sDsl[F]`
    * create an object that extends `Http4sDsl[F]`, and extend that.
    * `import org.http4s.dsl.io._` is still available for those who
      wish to specialize on `cats.effect.IO`
* Remove `Semigroup[F[MaybeResponse[F]]]` constraint from
  `BlazeBuilder`.
* Fix `AutoSlash` middleware when a service is mounted with a prefix.
* Publish internal http4s-parboiled2 as a separate module.  This does
  not add any new third-party dependencies, but unbreaks `sbt
  publishLocal`.
* Add `Request.from`, which respects `X-Fowarded-For` header.
* Make `F` in `EffectMessageSyntax` invariant
* Add `message.decodeJson[A]` syntax to replace awkward `message.as(implicitly,
  jsonOf[A])`. Brought into scope by importing one of the following, based on
  your JSON library of choice.
  * `import org.http4s.argonaut._`
  * `import org.http4s.circe._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.jackson._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.native._`
* `AsyncHttpClient.apply` no longer takes a `bufferSize`.  It is made
  irrelevant by fs2-reactive-streams.
* `MultipartParser.parse` no longer takes a `headerLimit`, which was unused.
* Add `maxWaitQueueLimit` (default 256) and `maxConnectionsPerRequestKey`
  (default 10) to `PooledHttp1Client`.
* Remove private implicit `ExecutionContext` from `StreamApp`. This had been
  known to cause diverging implicit resolution that was hard to debug.
* Shift execution of the routing of the `HttpService` to the `ExecutionContext`
  provided by the `JettyBuilder` or `TomcatBuilder`. Previously, it only shifted
  the response task and stream. This was a regression from v0.16.
* Add two utility execution contexts. These may be used to increase throughput
  as the server builder's `ExecutionContext`. Blocking calls on routing may
  decrease fairness or even deadlock your service, so use at your own risk:
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.direct`
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.trampoline`
* Deprecate `EffectRequestSyntax` and `EffectResponseSyntax`. These were
  previously used to provide methods such as `.putHeaders` and `.withBody`
  on types `F[Request]` and `F[Response]`.  As an alternative:
  * Call `.map` or `.flatMap` on `F[Request]` and `F[Response]` to get access
    to all the same methods.
  * Variadic headers have been added to all the status code generators in
    `Http4sDsl[F]` and method generators in `import org.http4s.client._`.
    For example:
    * `POST(uri, urlForm, Header("Authorization", "Bearer s3cr3t"))`
    * ``Ok("This will have an html content type!", `Content-Type`(`text/html`))``
* Restate `HttpService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], Response[F]]`.
* Similarly, `AuthedService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], AuthedRequest[F], Response[F]]`.
* `MaybeResponse` is removed, because the optionality is now expressed through
  the `OptionT` in `HttpService`. Instead of composing `HttpService` via a
  `Semigroup`, compose via a `SemigroupK`. Import `org.http4s.implicits._` to
  get a `SemigroupK[HttpService]`, and chain services as `s1 <+> s2`. We hope to
  remove the need for `org.http4s.implicits._` in a future version of cats with
  [issue 1428](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1428).
* The `Service` type alias is deprecated in favor of `Kleisli`.  It used to represent
  a partial application of the first type parameter, but since version 0.18, it is
  identical to `Kleisli.
* `HttpService.lift`, `AuthedService.lift` are deprecated in favor of `Kleisli.apply`.
* Remove `java.xml.bind` dependency from `GZip` middleware to avoid an
  extra module dependency in Java 9.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M2
    * log4s-1.4.0
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.3 (2017-10-02)
* Shift execution of HttpService to the `ExecutionContext` provided by the
  `BlazeBuilder` when using HTTP/2. Previously, it only shifted the response
  task and body stream.

# v0.16.3 (2017-09-29)
* Fix `java.io.IOException: An invalid argument was supplied` on blaze-client
  for Windows when writing an empty sequence of `ByteBuffer`s.
* Set encoding of `captureWriter` to UTF-8 instead of the platform default.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * blaze-0.12.9

# v0.17.2 (2017-09-25)
* Remove private implicit strategy from `StreamApp`. This had been known to
  cause diverging implicit resolution that was hard to debug.
* Shift execution of HttpService to the `ExecutionContext` provided by the
  `BlazeBuilder`. Previously, it only shifted the response stream. This was a
  regression from 0.16.
* Split off http4s-parboiled2 module as `"org.http4s" %% "parboiled"`. There are
  no externally visible changes, but this simplifies and speeds the http4s
  build.

# v0.16.2 (2017-09-25)
* Dependency patch upgrades:
  * async-http-client-2.0.37
  * blaze-0.12.8: changes default number of selector threads to
    from `2 * cores + 1` to `max(4, cores + 1)`.
  * jetty-9.4.7.v20170914
  * tomcat-8.5.21
  * twirl-1.3.7

# v0.17.1 (2017-09-17)
* Fix bug where metrics were not captured in `Metrics` middleware.
* Pass `redactHeadersWhen` argument from `Logger` to `RequestLogger`
  and `ResponseLogger`.

# v0.16.1 (2017-09-17)
* Publish our fork of parboiled2 as http4s-parboiled2 module.  It's
  the exact same internal code as was in http4s-core, with no external
  dependencies. By publishing an extra module, we enable a
  `publishLocal` workflow.
* Charset fixes: 
  * Deprecate `CharsetRange.isSatisfiedBy` in favor of
    and ```Accept-Charset`.isSatisfiedBy`` in favor of
    ```Accept-Charset`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    ```Charset`.*``.
  * Add `CharsetRange.matches`.
* ContentCoding fixes: 
  * Deprecate `ContentCoding.satisfiedBy` and
    `ContentCoding.satisfies` in favor of ```Accept-Encoding`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Deprecate ```Accept-Encoding`.preferred``, which has no reasonable
    interpretation in the presence of splats.
  * Add ```Accept-Language`.qValue``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    `ContentCoding.*`.
  * Add `ContentCoding.matches` and `ContentCoding.registered`.
  * Add `Arbitrary[ContentCoding]` and ```Arbitrary[`Accept-Encoding`]`` 
    instances.
* LanguageTag fixes: 
  * Deprecate `LanguageTag.satisfiedBy` and
    `LanguageTag.satisfies` in favor of ```Accept-Language`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    `LanguageTag.*` and matches of a partial set of subtags.
  * Add `LanguageTag.matches`.
  * Deprecate `LanguageTag.withQuality` in favor of new
    `LanguageTag.withQValue`.
  * Deprecate ```Accept-Language`.preferred``, which has no reasonable
    interpretation in the presence of splats.
  * Add ```Accept-Language`.qValue``.
  * Add `Arbitrary[LanguageTag]` and ```Arbitrary[`Accept-Language`]``
    instances.

# v0.17.0 (2017-09-01)
* Honor `Retry-After` header in `Retry` middleware.  The response will
  not be retried until the maximum of the backoff strategy and any
  time specified by the `Retry-After` header of the response.
* The `RetryPolicy.defaultRetriable` only works for methods guaranteed
  to not have a body.  In fs2, we can't introspect the stream to
  guarantee that it can be rerun.  To retry requests for idempotent
  request methods, use `RetryPolicy.unsafeRetriable`.  To retry
  requests regardless of method, use
  `RetryPolicy.recklesslyRetriable`.
* Fix `Logger` middleware to render JSON bodies as text, not as a hex
  dump.
* `MultipartParser.parse` returns a stream of `ByteVector` instead of
  a stream of `Byte`. This perserves chunking when parsing into the
  high-level `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`, and substantially improves
  performance on large files.  The high-level API is not affected.

# v0.16.0 (2017-09-01)
* `Retry` middleware takes a `RetryPolicy` instead of a backoff
  strategy.  A `RetryPolicy` is a function of the request, the
  response, and the number of attempts.  Wrap the previous `backoff`
  in `RetryPolicy {}` for compatible behavior.
* Expose a `Part.fileData` constructor that accepts an `EntityBody`.

# v0.17.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* In blaze-server, when doing chunked transfer encoding, flush the
  header as soon as it is available.  It previously buffered until the
  first chunk was available.

# v0.16.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* Add a `responseHeaderTimeout` property to `BlazeClientConfig`.  This
  measures the time between the completion of writing the request body
  to the reception of a complete response header.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.35

# v0.18.0-M1 (2107-08-24)

This release is the product of a long period of parallel development
across different foundation libraries, making a detailed changelog
difficult.  This is a living document, so if any important points are
missed here, please send a PR.

The most important change in http4s-0.18 is that the effect type is
parameterized.  Where previous versions were specialized on
`scalaz.concurrent.Task` or `fs2.Task`, this version supports anything
with a `cats.effect.Effect` instance.  The easiest way to port an
existing service is to replace your `Task` with `cats.effect.IO`,
which has a similar API and is already available on your classpath.
If you prefer to bring your own effect, such as `monix.eval.Task` or
stick to `scalaz.concurrent.Task` or put a transformer on `IO`, that's
fine, too!

The parameterization chanages many core signatures throughout http4s:
- `Request` and `Response` become `Request[F[_]]` and
  `Response[F[_]]`.  The `F` is the effect type of the body (i.e.,
  `Stream[F, Byte]`), or what the body `.run`s to.
- `HttpService` becomes `HttpService[F[_]]`, so that the service
  returns an `F[Response[F]]`.  Instead of constructing with
  `HttpService { ... }`, we now declare the effect type of the
  service, like `HttpService[IO] { ... }`.  This determines the type
  of request and response handled by the service.
- `EntityEncoder[A]` and `EntityDecoder[A]` are now
  `EntityEncoder[F[_], A]` and `EntityDecoder[F[_], A]`, respectively.
  These act as a codec for `Request[F]` and `Response[F]`.  In practice,
  this change tends to be transparent in the DSL.
- The server builders now take an `F` parameter, which needs to match
  the services mounted to them.
- The client now takes an `F` parameter, which determines the requests
  and responses it handles.

Several dependencies are upgraded:
- cats-1.0.0.MF
- circe-0.9.0-M1
- fs2-0.10.0-M6
- fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.2
- jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M1

# v0.17.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Remove `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound(a: A): Task[Response]` in favor of
  `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound: Service[Request, Response]`

# v0.16.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Move http4s-blaze-core from `org.http4s.blaze` to
  `org.http4s.blazecore` to avoid a conflict with the non-http4s
  blaze-core module.
* Change `ServiceOps` to operate on a `Service[?, MaybeResponse]`.
  Give it an `orNotFound` that returns a `Service`.  The
  `orNotFound(a: A)` overload is left for compatibility with Scala
  2.10.
* Build with Lightbend compiler instead of Typelevel compiler so we
  don't expose `org.typelevel` dependencies that are incompatible with
  ntheir counterparts in `org.scala-lang`.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * blaze-0.12.7 (fixes eviction notice in http4s-websocket)
    * twirl-1.3.4

# v0.17.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Port `ChunkAggregator` to fs2
* Add logging middleware
* Standardize on `ExecutionContext` over `Strategy` and `ExecutorService`
* Implement `Age` header
* Fix `Client#toHttpService` to not dispose until the body is consumed
* Add a buffered implementation of `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`
* In async-http-client, don't use `ReactiveStreamsBodyGenerator` unless there is
  a body to transmit. This fixes an `IllegalStateException: unexpected message
  type`
* Add `HSTS` middleware
* Add option to serve pre-gzipped resources
* Add RequestLogging and ResponseLogging middlewares
* `StaticFile` options return `OptionT[Task, ?]`
* Set `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header when serving
  from a URL
* Explicitly close `URLConnection``s if we are not reading the contents
* Upgrade to:
    * async-http-client-2.0.34
    * fs2-0.9.7
    * metrics-core-3.2.4
    * scodec-bits-1.1.5

# v0.16.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Remove laziness from `ArbitraryInstances`
* Support an arbitrary predicate for CORS allowed origins
* Support `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header for CORS
* Fix thread safety issue in `EntityDecoder[XML]`
* Support IPV6 headers in `X-Forwarded-For`
* Add `status` and `successful` methods to client
* Overload `client.fetchAs` and `client.streaming` to accept a `Task[Request]`
* Replace `Instant` with `HttpDate` to avoid silent truncation and constrain
  to dates that are legally renderable in HTTP.
* Fix bug in hash code of `CaseInsensitiveString`
* Update `request.pathInfo` when changing `request.withUri`. To keep these
  values in sync, `request.copy` has been deprecated, but copy constructors
  based on `with` have been added.
* Remove `name` from `AttributeKey`.
* Add `withFragment` and `withoutFragment` to `Uri`
* Construct `Content-Length` with `fromLong` to ensure validity, and
  `unsafeFromLong` when you can assert that it's positive.
* Add missing instances to `QueryParamDecoder` and `QueryParamEncoder`.
* Add `response.cookies` method to get a list of cookies from `Set-Cookie`
  header.  `Set-Cookie` is no longer a `Header.Extractable`, as it does
  not adhere to the HTTP spec of being concatenable by commas without
  changing semantics.
* Make servlet `HttpSession` available as a request attribute in servlet
  backends
* Fix `Part.name` to return the name from the `Content-Disposition` header
  instead of the name _of_ the `Content-Disposition` header. Accordingly, it is
  no longer a `CaseInsensitiveString`
* `Request.toString` and `Response.toString` now redact sensitive headers. A
  method to redact arbitrary headers is added to `Headers`.
* `Retry-After` is now modeled as a `Either[HttpDate, Long]` to reflect either
  an http-date or delta-seconds value.
* Look for index.html in `StaticFile` when rendering a directory instead of
  returning `401 Unauthorized`.
* Limit dates to a minimum of January 1, 1900, per RFC.
* Add `serviceErrorHandler` to `ServerBuilder` to allow pluggable error handlers
  when a server backend receives a failed task or a thrown Exception when
  invoking a service. The default calls `toHttpResponse` on `MessageFailure` and
  closes the connection with a `500 InternalServerError` on other non-fatal
  errors.  Fatal errors are left to the server.
* `FollowRedirect` does not propagate sensitive headers when redirecting to a
  different authority.
* Add Content-Length header to empty response generators
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.34
    * http4s-websocket-0.2.0
    * jetty-9.4.6.v20170531
    * json4s-3.5.3
    * log4s-1.3.6
    * metrics-core-3.2.3
    * scala-2.12.3-bin-typelevel-4
    * scalaz-7.2.15
    * tomcat-8.5.20

# v0.15.16 (2017-07-20)
* Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`

# ~~v0.15.15 (2017-07-20)~~
* Oops. Same as v0.15.14.

# v0.15.14 (2017-07-10)
* Close parens in `Request.toString`
* Use "message" instead of "request" in message body failure messages
* Add `problem+json` media type
* Tolerate `[` and `]` in queries parsing URIs. These characters are parsed, but
  percent-encoded.

# v0.17.0-M3 (2017-05-27)
* Fix file corruption issue when serving static files from the classpath

# v0.16.0-M3 (2017-05-25)
* Fix `WebjarService` so it matches assets.
* `ServerApp` overrides `process` to leave a single abstract method
* Add gzip trailer in `GZip` middleware
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * circe-0.8.0
    * jetty-9.4.5.v20170502
    * scalaz-7.2.13
    * tomcat-8.5.15
* `ProcessApp` uses a `Process[Task, Nothing]` rather than a
  `Process[Task, Unit]`
* `Credentials` is split into `Credentials.AuthParams` for key-value pairs and
  `Credentials.Token` for legacy token-based schemes.  `OAuthBearerToken` is
  subsumed by `Credentials.Token`.  `BasicCredentials` no longer extends
  `Credentials`, but is extractable from one.  This model permits the
  definition of other arbitrary credential schemes.
* Add `fromSeq` constructor to `UrlForm`
* Allow `WebjarService` to pass on methods other than `GET`.  It previously
  threw a `MatchError`.

# v0.15.13 (2017-05-25)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.32
    * blaze-0.12.6 (fixes infinite loop in some SSL handshakes)
    * jetty-9.3.19.v20170502
    * json4s-3.5.2
    * tomcat-8.0.44

# v0.15.12 (2017-05-11)
* Fix GZip middleware to render a correct stream

# v0.17.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* `Timeout` middleware takes an implicit `Scheduler` and
  `ExecutionContext`
* Bring back `http4s-async-client`, based on `fs2-reactive-stream`
* Restore support for WebSockets

# v0.16.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* Upgraded dependencies:
    * argonaut-6.2
    * jetty-9.4.4.v20170414
    * tomcat-8.5.14
* Fix `ProcessApp` to terminate on process errors
* Set `secure` request attribute correctly in blaze server
* Exit with code `-1` when `ProcessApp` fails
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Rename `ProcessApp.main` to `ProcessApp.process` to avoid overload confusio
* Avoid intermediate String allocation in Circe's `jsonEncoder`
* Adaptive EntityDecoder[Json] for circe: works directly from a ByteBuffer for
  small bodies, and incrementally through jawn for larger.
* Capture more context in detail message of parse errors

# v0.15.11 (2017-04-29)
* Upgrade to blaze-0.12.5 to pick up fix for `StackOverflowError` in
  SSL handshake

# v0.15.10 (2017-04-28)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies
* argonaut-6.2
* scalaz-7.2.12
* Allow preambles and epilogues in multipart bodies
* Limit multipart headers to 40 kilobytes to avoid unbounded buffering
  of long lines in a header
* Remove `' '` and `'?'` from alphabet for generated multipart
  boundaries, as these are not token characters and are known to cause
  trouble for some multipart implementations
* Fix multipart parsing for unlucky input chunk sizes

# v0.15.9 (2017-04-19)
* Terminate `ServerApp` even if the server fails to start
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
* async-http-client-2.0.31
* jetty-9.3.18.v20170406
* json4s-3.5.1
* log4s-1.3.4
* metrics-core-3.1.4
* scalacheck-1.13.5
* scalaz-7.1.13 or scalaz-7.2.11
* tomcat-8.0.43

# v0.17.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* First release on cats and fs2
    * All scalaz types and typeclasses replaced by cats equivalengts
	* `scalaz.concurrent.Task` replaced by `fs2.Task`	
	* `scalaz.stream.Process` replaced by `fs2.Stream`
* Roughly at feature parity with v0.16.0-M1. Notable exceptions:
	* Multipart not yet supported
	* Web sockets not yet supported
	* Client retry middleware can't check idempotence of requests
	* Utilties in `org.http4s.util.io` not yet ported

# v0.16.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* Fix type of `AuthedService.empty`
* Eliminate `Fallthrough` typeclass.  An `HttpService` now returns
  `MaybeResponse`, which can be a `Response` or `Pass`.  There is a
  `Semigroup[MaybeResponse]` instance that allows `HttpService`s to be
  chained as a semigroup.  `service orElse anotherService` is
  deprecated in favor of `service |+| anotherService`.
* Support configuring blaze and Jetty servers with a custom
  `SSLContext`.
* Upgraded dependencies for various modules:
    * async-http-client-2.0.31
    * circe-0.7.1
    * jetty-9.4.3.v20170317
    * json4s-3.5.1
    * logback-1.2.1
    * log4s-1.3.4
    * metrics-3.2.0
    * scalacheck-1.13.5
    * tomcat-8.0.43
* Deprecate `EntityEncoder[ByteBuffer]` and
  `EntityEncoder[CharBuffer]`.
* Add `EntityDecoder[Unit]`.
* Move `ResponseClass`es into `Status`.
* Use `SSLContext.getDefault` by default in blaze-client.  Use
  `BlazeServerConfig.insecure` to ignore certificate validity.  But
  please don't.
* Move `CaseInsensitiveString` syntax to `org.http4s.syntax`.
* Bundle an internal version of parboiled2.  This decouples core from
  shapeless, allowing applications to use their preferred version of
  shapeless.
* Rename `endpointAuthentication` to `checkEndpointAuthentication`.
* Add a `WebjarService` for serving files out of web jars.
* Implement `Retry-After` header.
* Stop building with `delambdafy` on Scala 2.11.
* Eliminate finalizer on `BlazeConnection`.
* Respond OK to CORS pre-flight requests even if the wrapped service
  does not return a successful response.  This is to allow `CORS`
  pre-flight checks of authenticated services.
* Deprecate `ServerApp` in favor of `org.http4s.util.ProcessApp`.  A
  `ProcessApp` is easier to compose all the resources a server needs via
  `Process.bracket`.
* Implement a `Referer` header.

# v0.15.8 (2017-04-06)
* Cache charset lookups to avoid synchronization.  Resolution of
  charsets is synchronized, with a cache size of two.  This avoids
  the synchronized call on the HTTP pool.
* Strip fragment from request target in blaze-client.  An HTTP request
  target should not include the fragment, and certain servers respond
  with a `400 Bad Request` in their presence.

# v0.15.7 (2017-03-09)
* Change default server and client executors to a minimum of four
  threads.
* Bring scofflaw async-http-client to justice for its brazen
  violations of Reactive Streams Rule 3.16, requesting of a null
  subscription.
* Destroy Tomcat instances after stopping, so they don't hold the port
* Deprecate `ArbitraryInstances.genCharsetRangeNoQuality`, which can
  cause deadlocks
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
    * async-http-client-2.0.30
    * jetty-9.3.16.v20170120
    * logback-1.1.11
    * metrics-3.1.3
    * scala-xml-1.0.6
    * scalaz-7.2.9
    * tomcat-8.0.41
    * twirl-1.2.1

# v0.15.6 (2017-03-03)
* Log unhandled MessageFailures to `org.http4s.server.message-failures`

# v0.15.5 (2017-02-20)
* Allow services wrapped in CORS middleware to fall through
* Don't log message about invalid CORS headers when no `Origin` header present
* Soften log about invalid CORS headers from info to debug

# v0.15.4 (2017-02-12)
* Call `toHttpResponse` on tasks failed with `MessageFailure`s from
  `HttpService`, to get proper 4xx handling instead of an internal
  server error.

# v0.15.3 (2017-01-17)
* Dispose of redirect responses in `FollowRedirect`. Fixes client deadlock under heavy load
* Refrain from logging headers with potentially sensitive info in blaze-client
* Add `hashCode` and `equals` to `Headers`
* Make `challenge` in auth middlewares public to facilitate composing multiple auth mechanisms
* Fix blaze-client detection of stale connections

# v0.15.2 (2016-12-29)
* Add helpers to add cookies to requests

# v0.12.6 (2016-12-29)
* Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`

# ~~v0.12.5 (2016-12-29)~~
* ~~Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`~~ Oops.

# v0.15.1 (2016-12-20)
* Fix GZip middleware to fallthrough non-matching responses

* Eliminate response attribute for detecting fallthrough response.
  The fallthrough response must be `Response.fallthrough`.
* Encode URI path segments created with `/`
* Introduce `AuthedRequest` and `AuthedService` types.
* Replace `CharSequenceEncoder` with `CharBufferEncoder`, assuming
  that `CharBuffer` and `String` are the only `CharSequence`s one
  would want to encode.
* Remove `EnittyEncoder[Char]` and `EntityEncoder[Byte]`.  Send an
  array, buffer, or String if you want this.
* Add `DefaultHead` middleware for `HEAD` implementation.
* Decouple `http4s-server` from Dropwizard Metrics.  Metrics code is
  in the new `http4s-metrics` module.
* Allow custom scheduler for timeout middleware.
* Add parametric empty `EntityEncoder` and `EntityEncoder[Unit]`.
* Replace unlawful `Order[CharsetRange]` with `Equal[CharsetRange]`.
* Auth middlewares renamed `BasicAuth` and `DigestAuth`.
* `BasicAuth` passes client password to store instead of requesting
  password from store.
* Remove realm as an argument to the basic and digest auth stores.
* Basic and digest auth stores return a parameterized type instead of
  just a String username.
* Upgrade to argonaut-6.2-RC2, circe-0.6.1, json4s-3.5.0

# v0.14.11 (2016-10-25)
* Fix expansion of `uri` and `q` macros by qualifying with `_root_`

# v0.14.10 (2016-10-12)
