http4s uses Scala's type system to increase self-documentation and
compile-time verification.  Standard headers are lazily parsed to
semantically meaningful types, and typeclasses are provided to
encode and decode bodies to several common formats.

The pure functional side of Scala is favored to promote
composability and easy reasoning about your code.  The core is
built on an immutable case class model of HTTP requests and
responses, shared by the client and the server.

http4s is built on [scalaz-streams]<span data-footnote="1"/>,
which provides the foundation for processing and emitting large
payloads in constant space and implementing websockets.
  
A port from scalaz-stream to [fs2] and [cats] is in progress.
