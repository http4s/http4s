## Dependencies

http4s stands on the shoulders of giants.  To use it most effectively,
it helps to be familiar with its dependencies.

* [Cats](https://typelevel.github.io/cats) provides typeclasses and a
  few core data types.
  * [Resources for Learners](https://typelevel.org/cats/resources_for_learners.html)
* [cats-effect](https://typelevel.github.io/cats-effect) is used to
  mark effectful code.
  * [An IO monad for cats](https://typelevel.org/blog/2017/05/02/io-monad-for-cats.html)
* [FS2](https://functional-streams-for-scala.github.io/fs2/) provides
  support for streaming.
  * [The Official Guide](https://github.com/functional-streams-for-scala/fs2/blob/series/0.10/docs/guide.md)
