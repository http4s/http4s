  * If the service returns the fallthrough response, the request is resubmitted
  * as a GET.  The resulting response's body is killed, but all headers are
  * preserved.  This is a naive, but correct, implementation of HEAD.  Routes
  * requiring more optimization should implement their own HEAD handler.
