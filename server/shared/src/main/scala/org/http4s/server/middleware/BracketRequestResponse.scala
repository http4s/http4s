/** Middelwares which allow for bracketing on a Request/Response, including
  * the completion of the Response body stream.
  *
  * These are analogous to `cats.effect.Bracket` and `fs2.Stream.bracket`. The
  * reason that they exist is because due to the full termination of a
  * Response being a function of the termination of the `fs2.Stream` which
  * backs the response body, you can't actually use either
  * `cats.effect.Bracket` or `fs2.Stream.bracket` directly.
  *
  * @define releaseWarning The bracketing semantics defined here differ in one
  *         very important way from cats-effect or fs2 bracketing
  *         semantics. If the [[Response]] body is not evaluated after the
  *         application of the middleware, then the `release` handler ''will
  *         not run, effectively creating a resource leak.'' This can happen
  *         due to a bug in a server implementation, where it fails to drain
  *         the body, or due to a user code if the [[Response]] body stream
  *         (or the [[Response]] itself) is discarded after the application of
  *         this middleware. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to avoid
  *         this. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that this
  *         middleware be applied at the most outer scope possible. Appending
  *         to or transforming the [[Response]] body ''is safe'' to do after
  *         the application of this middleware.

    *
    * This middleware uses a context on both the Request and Response. This is
    * the most general possible encoding for bracketing on a Request/Response
    * interaction. It is required to express certain types of bracketing use
    * cases (see Metrics), but for most cases it is more general than is
    * needed. Before attempting to use this middleware, you should consider if
    * [[bracketRequestResponseRoutes]] or
    * [[bracketRequestResponseCaseRoutes]] will work for your use case.
    *
    * @note $releaseWarning
    *
    * @note For some use cases, you might want to differentiate between each
    *       of the three exit branches where `release` may be invoked. The
    *       three exit branches are, running a [[Request]] and receiving
    *       `OptionT.none[F, Response[F]]`, running a [[Request]] and
    *       encountering an error or cancellation before the [[Response]] is
    *       generated, or at the full consumption of the [[Response]] body
    *       stream (regardless of the `ExitCase`). One may determine the in
    *       which branch `release` is being invoked by inspecting the
    *       `ExitCase` and the `Option[B]` response context. If the response
    *       context is defined, e.g. `Some(_: B)`, then you can be certain
    *       that the `release` function was executed at the termination of the
    *       body stream. This is because the response context is only (and
    *       always) present if the [[Response]] value was generated
    *       successfully (whether or not the body stream fails). If the
    *       `ExitCase` is `Completed` and the response context is `None`, then
    *       that means that the underlying [[HttpRoutes]] did not yield a
    *       [[Response]], e.g. we got `OptionT.none: OptionT[F, Response[F]]`.
    *       Otherwise, if the `ExitCase` is either `Error(_: Throwable)` or
    *       `Canceled`, and the response context is `None`, then `release` is
    *       executed in response to an error or cancellation during the
    *       generation of the [[Response]] value proper, e.g. when running the
    *       underlying `HttpRoutes`.
    *
    * @note A careful reader might be wondering where the analogous `use`
    *       parameter from `cats.effect.Bracket` has gone. The use of the
    *       acquired resource is running the request, thus the `use` function
    *       is actually just the normal context route function from http4s
    *       `Kleisli[OptionT[F, *], ContextRequest[F, A], Response[F]]`.
    *
    * @param acquire Function of the [[Request]] to a `F[ContextRequest]` to
    *        run each time a new [[Request]] is received.
    *
    * @param release Function to run on the termination of a Request/Response
    *        interaction, in all cases. The first argument is the request
    *        context, which is guaranteed to exist if acquire succeeds. The
    *        second argument is the response context, which will only exist if
    *        the generation of the `ContextResponse` is successful. The third
    *        argument is the exit condition, either completed, canceled, or
    *        error.
