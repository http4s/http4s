/** Middleware for caching the request body for multiple compilations
  *
  * As the body of the request is the [[Stream]] of bytes,
  * compiling it several times (e.g. with middlewares) is unsafe.
  * This middleware forbids such behaviour, compiling the body only once.
  * It does so only for the "inner" middlewares:
  *
  * {{{
  * val route = AMiddleware(BodyCache(SomeOtherMiddleware(myRoute)))
  * }}}
  *
  * In this example only `myRoute` & `SomeOtherMiddleware` will receive cached request body,
  * while the `AMiddleware` will get the raw one.
  *
  * As the entire request body will be allocated in memory,
  * there is a possibility of OOM error with a large body.
  * Because of that, using the `EntityLimiter` middleware is strongly advised.
  *
  * @note This middleware has nothing to do with the HTTP caching mechanism
  *       and it does not cache bodies between multiple requests.
