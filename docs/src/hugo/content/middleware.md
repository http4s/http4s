A middleware is a wrapper around a [service] that provides a means of manipulating
the `Request` sent to service, and/or the `Response` returned by the service. In 
some cases, such as [Authentication], middleware may even prevent the service
from being called.

At it's most basic, middleware is simply a function that takes one `Service` as a
parameter and returns another `Service`. In addition to the `Service`, the middleware
function can take any additional parameters it needs to perform it's task. Let's look 
at a simple example.

For this, we'll need a dependency on the http4s [dsl].

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-dsl" % http4sVersion
)
```
and some imports.

```tut:silent
import org.http4s._
import org.http4s.dsl._
```

Then, we can create a middleware that adds a header to successful responses from
the wrapped service like this. 

```tut:book
def myMiddle(service: HttpService, header: Header): HttpService = Service.lift { req =>
  service(req).map {resp =>
    if (resp.status.isSuccess)
      resp.putHeaders(header)
    else
      resp
  }
}
```

All we do here is pass the request to the service,
which returns a `Task[Rresponse]`. So, we use `map` to get the request out of the task,
add the header if the response is a success, and then pass the response on. We could
just as easily modify the request before we passed it to the service.

Now, let's create a simple service. As mentioned in [service], because `Service` 
is implemented as a `Kleisli`, which is just a function at heart, we can test a
service without a server. Because an `HttpService` returns a `Task[Response]`, 
we need to call `run` on the result of the function to extract the `Response`.

```tut:book
val service = HttpService {
  case GET -> Root / "bad" =>
    BadRequest()
  case _ =>
    Ok()
}

val goodRequest = Request(Method.GET, uri("/"))
val badRequest = Request(Method.GET, uri("/bad"))

service(goodRequest).run
service(badRequest).run
```

Now, we'll wrap the service in our middleware to create a new service, and try it out.

```tut:book
val wrappedService = myMiddle(service, Header("SomeKey", "SomeValue"));

wrappedService(goodRequest).run
wrappedService(badRequest).run
```
Note that the successful response has our header added to it.

If you intend to use you middleware in multiple places,  you may want to implement 
it as an `object` and use the `apply` method.

```tut:book
object MyMiddle {
  def addHeader(resp: Response, header: Header) =
    if (resp.status.isSuccess) resp.putHeaders(header)
    else resp

  def apply(service: HttpService, header: Header) =
    service.map(addHeader(_, header))
}

val newService = MyMiddle(service, Header("SomeKey", "SomeValue"))

newService(goodRequest).run
newService(badRequest).run
```

It is possible for the wrapped `Service` to have different `Request` and `Response`
types than the middleware. Authorization is, again, a good example. Authorization 
middleware is an `HttpService` (an alias for `Service[Request, Response]`) that wraps an `
AuthedService` (an alias for `Service[AuthedRequest[T], Response]`. There is a type 
defined for this in the `http4s.server` package:

```scala
type AuthMiddleware[T] = Middleware[AuthedRequest[T], Response, Request, Response]
```
See the [Authentication] documentation for more details.
 
## Composing Services with Middleware
Because middleware returns a `Service`, you can compose services wrapped in 
middleware with other, unwrapped, services, or services wrapped in other middleware.
You can also wrap a single service in multiple layers of middleware. For example:

```tut:book
val apiService = HttpService {
  case GET -> Root / "api" =>
    Ok()
}

import org.http4s.server.syntax._
val aggregateService = apiService orElse MyMiddle(service, Header("SomeKey", "SomeValue"))

val apiRequest = Request(Method.GET, uri("/api"))

aggregateService(goodRequest).run
aggregateService(apiRequest).run
```

Note that `goodRequest` ran through the `MyMiddle` middleware and the `Result` had
our header added to it. But, `apiRequest` did not go through the middleware and did
not have the header added to it's `Result`.

## Included Middleware
Http4s includes some middleware Out of the Box in the `org.http4s.server.middleware`
package. These include:

* [Authentication]
* Cross Origin Resource Sharing ([CORS])
* Response Compression ([GZip])
* Service Timeout
* Jsonp
* Virtual Host

And a few others.

[dsl]: ../dsl
[Authentication]: ../auth
[CORS]: ../cors
[GZip]: ../gzip
