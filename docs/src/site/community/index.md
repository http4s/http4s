<h2><i class="fa fa-gift"></i> Contributing</h2>
 
http4s is an open source project, and depends on its users to continue
to improve.  Here's how you can help:

* [Submit an issue](http://github.com/http4s/http4s/issues/new).  Bug
  reports, feature requests, whatever.  No nit too small to pick.
* Send us a pull request with your original work, compatible with the
  [project's Apache 2
  Licence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/http4s/http4s/master/LICENSE).
  Before a major change, please file an issue or contact us first, so
  we're not duplicating effort.
* If you found the project helpful, pay it forward with a contribution
  to the docs. This site is a simple [Jekyll/tut
  project](http://github.com/http4s/http4s/tree/master/src/docs) in
  our main repo.
