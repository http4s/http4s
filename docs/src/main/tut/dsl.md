title: The http4s DSL
---

Recall from earlier that an `HttpRoutes[F]` is just a type alias for
`Kleisli[OptionT[F, *], Request[F], Response[F]]`.  This provides a minimal
foundation for declaring services and executing them on blaze or a
servlet container.  While this foundation is composable, it is not
highly productive.  Most service authors will seek a higher level DSL.

## Add the http4s-dsl to your build

One option is the http4s-dsl.  It is officially supported by the
http4s team, but kept separate from core in order to encourage
multiple approaches for different needs.

This tutorial assumes that http4s-dsl is on your classpath.  Add the
following to your build.sbt:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-dsl" % http4sVersion,
)
```

All we need is a REPL to follow along at home:

```
$ sbt console
```

## The simplest service

We'll need the following imports to get started:

```tut:silent
import cats.effect._
import org.http4s._, org.http4s.dsl.io._, org.http4s.implicits._
// Provided by `cats.effect.IOApp`
implicit val timer : Timer[IO] = IO.timer(scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global)
```

The central concept of http4s-dsl is pattern matching.  An
`HttpRoutes[F]` is declared as a simple series of case statements.  Each
case statement attempts to match and optionally extract from an
incoming `Request[F]`.  The code associated with the first matching case
is used to generate a `F[Response[F]]`.

The simplest case statement matches all requests without extracting
anything.  The right hand side of the request must return a
`F[Response[F]]`.

In the following we use `cats.effect.IO` as the effect type `F`.

```tut:book
val service = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case _ =>
    IO(Response(Status.Ok))
}
```

## Testing the Service

One beautiful thing about the `HttpRoutes[F]` model is that we don't
need a server to test our route.  We can construct our own request
and experiment directly in the REPL.

```tut
val getRoot = Request[IO](Method.GET, uri"/")

val io = service.orNotFound.run(getRoot)
```

Where is our `Response[F]`?  It hasn't been created yet.  We wrapped it
in an `IO`.  In a real service, generating a `Response[F]` is likely to
be an asynchronous operation with side effects, such as invoking
another web service or querying a database, or maybe both.  Operating
in a `F` gives us control over the sequencing of operations and
lets us reason about our code like good functional programmers.  It is
the `HttpRoutes[F]`'s job to describe the task, and the server's job to
run it.

But here in the REPL, it's up to us to run it:

```tut
val response = io.unsafeRunSync
```

Cool.

## Generating responses

We'll circle back to more sophisticated pattern matching of requests,
but it will be a tedious affair until we learn a more succinct way of
generating `F[Response]`s.

### Status codes

http4s-dsl provides a shortcut to create an `F[Response]` by
applying a status code:

```tut
val okIo = Ok()
val ok = okIo.unsafeRunSync
```

This simple `Ok()` expression succinctly says what we mean in a
service:

```tut:book
HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case _ => Ok()
}.orNotFound.run(getRoot).unsafeRunSync
```

This syntax works for other status codes as well.  In our example, we
don't return a body, so a `204 No Content` would be a more appropriate
response:

```tut:book
HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case _ => NoContent()
}.orNotFound.run(getRoot).unsafeRunSync
```

### Headers

http4s adds a minimum set of headers depending on the response, e.g:

```tut
Ok("Ok response.").unsafeRunSync.headers
```

Extra headers can be added using `putHeaders`, for example to specify cache policies:

```tut:silent
import org.http4s.headers.`Cache-Control`
import org.http4s.CacheDirective.`no-cache`
import cats.data.NonEmptyList
```

```tut
Ok("Ok response.", `Cache-Control`(NonEmptyList(`no-cache`(), Nil))).unsafeRunSync.headers
```

http4s defines all the well known headers directly, but sometimes you need to
define custom headers, typically prefixed by an `X-`. In simple cases you can
construct a `Header` instance by hand:

```tut
Ok("Ok response.", Header("X-Auth-Token", "value")).unsafeRunSync.headers
```

### Cookies

http4s has special support for Cookie headers using the `Cookie` type to add
and invalidate cookies. Adding a cookie will generate the correct `Set-Cookie` header:

```tut
Ok("Ok response.").map(_.addCookie(ResponseCookie("foo", "bar"))).unsafeRunSync.headers
```

`Cookie` can be further customized to set, e.g., expiration, the secure flag, httpOnly, flag, etc

```tut
val cookieResp = {
  for {
    resp <- Ok("Ok response.")
    now <- HttpDate.current[IO]
  } yield resp.addCookie(ResponseCookie("foo", "bar", expires = Some(now), httpOnly = true, secure = true))
}
cookieResp.unsafeRunSync.headers
```

To request a cookie to be removed on the client, you need to set the cookie value
to empty. http4s can do that with `removeCookie`:

```tut
Ok("Ok response.").map(_.removeCookie("foo")).unsafeRunSync.headers
```

### Responding with a body

#### Simple bodies

Most status codes take an argument as a body.  In http4s, `Request[F]`
and `Response[F]` bodies are represented as a
`fs2.Stream[F, Byte]`.  It's also considered good
HTTP manners to provide a `Content-Type` and, where known in advance,
`Content-Length` header in one's responses.

All of this hassle is neatly handled by http4s' [EntityEncoder]s.
We'll cover these in more depth in another tut.  The important point
for now is that a response body can be generated for any type with an
implicit `EntityEncoder` in scope.  http4s provides several out of the
box:

```tut
Ok("Received request.").unsafeRunSync

import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8
Ok("binary".getBytes(UTF_8)).unsafeRunSync
```

Per the HTTP specification, some status codes don't support a body.
http4s prevents such nonsense at compile time:

```tut:fail
NoContent("does not compile")
```

#### Asynchronous responses

While http4s prefers `F[_]: Effect`, you may be working with libraries that
use standard library `Future`s.  Some relevant imports:

```tut:silent
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
```

You can respond with a `Future` of any type that has an
`EntityEncoder` by lifting it into `IO` or any `F[_]` that suspends future.
Note: unlike `IO`, wrapping a side effect in `Future` does not
suspend it, and the resulting expression would still be side
effectful, unless we wrap it in `IO`:

`IO.fromFuture` requires an implicit `ContextShift`, to ensure that the
suspended future is shifted to the corred thread pool.

```tut
implicit val cs: ContextShift[IO] = IO.contextShift(global)

val io = Ok(IO.fromFuture(IO(Future {
  println("I run when the future is constructed.")
  "Greetings from the future!"
})))
io.unsafeRunSync
```

As good functional programmers who like to delay our side effects, we
of course prefer to operate in `F`s:

```tut
val io = Ok(IO {
  println("I run when the IO is run.")
  "Mission accomplished!"
})
io.unsafeRunSync
```

Note that in both cases, a `Content-Length` header is calculated.
http4s waits for the `Future` or `F` to complete before wrapping it
in its HTTP envelope, and thus has what it needs to calculate a
`Content-Length`.

#### Streaming bodies

Streaming bodies are supported by returning a `fs2.Stream`.
Like `IO`, the stream may be of any type that has an
`EntityEncoder`.

An intro to `Stream` is out of scope, but we can glimpse the
power here.  This stream emits the elapsed time every 100 milliseconds
for one second:

```tut:silent
import fs2.Stream
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
```

```tut:book
val drip: Stream[IO, String] =
  Stream.awakeEvery[IO](100.millis).map(_.toString).take(10)
```

We can see it for ourselves in the REPL:

```tut
val dripOutIO = drip.through(fs2.text.lines).through(_.evalMap(s => {IO{println(s); s}})).compile.drain
dripOutIO.unsafeRunSync
```

When wrapped in a `Response[F]`, http4s will flush each chunk of a
`Stream` as they are emitted.  Note that a stream's length can't
generally be anticipated before it runs, so this triggers chunked
transfer encoding:

```tut
Ok(drip)
```

## Matching and extracting requests

A `Request` is a regular `case class` - you can destructure it to extract its
values. By extension, you can also `match/case` it with different possible
destructurings. To build these different extractors, you can make use of the
DSL.

### The `->` object

More often, you extract the `Request` into a HTTP `Method` and path
info via the `->` object.  On the left side is the method, and on the
right side, the path info.  The following matches a request to `GET
/hello`:

```tut
HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "hello" => Ok("hello")
}
```

Methods such as `GET` are typically found in `org.http4s.Method`, but are imported automatically as part of the DSL. 

### Path info

Path matching is done on the request's `pathInfo`.  Path info is the
request's URI's path after the following:

* the mount point of the service
* the prefix, if the service is composed with a `Router`
* the prefix, if the service is rewritten with `TranslateUri`

Matching on `request.pathInfo` instead of `request.uri.path` allows
multiple services to be composed without rewriting all the path
matchers.

### Matching paths

A request to the root of the service is matched with the `Root`
extractor.  `Root` consumes the leading slash of the path info.  The
following matches requests to `GET /`:

```tut
HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root => Ok("root")
}
```

We usually match paths in a left-associative manner with `Root` and
`/`.  Each `"/"` after the initial slash delimits a path segment, and
is represented in the DSL with the '/' extractor.  Segments can be
matched as literals or made available through standard Scala pattern
matching.  For example, the following service responds with "Hello,
Alice!" to `GET /hello/Alice`:

```tut
HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "hello" / name => Ok(s"Hello, $name!")
}
```

The above assumes only one path segment after `"hello"`, and would not
match `GET /hello/Alice/Bob`.  To match to an arbitrary depth, we need
a right-associative `/:` extractor.  In this case, there is no `Root`,
and the final pattern is a `Path` of the remaining segments.  This would
say `"Hello, Alice and Bob!"`

```tut
HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> "hello" /: rest => Ok(s"""Hello, ${rest.toList.mkString(" and ")}!""")
}
```

To match a file extension on a segment, use the `~` extractor:

```tut
HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / file ~ "json" => Ok(s"""{"response": "You asked for $file"}""")
}
```

### Handling path parameters
Path params can be extracted and converted to a specific type but are
`String`s by default. There are numeric extractors provided in the form
of `IntVar` and `LongVar`, as well as `UUIDVar` extractor for `java.util.UUID`.

```tut:book
def getUserName(userId: Int): IO[String] = ???

val usersService = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "users" / IntVar(userId) =>
    Ok(getUserName(userId))
}
```

If you want to extract a variable of type `T`, you can provide a custom extractor
object which implements `def unapply(str: String): Option[T]`, similar to the way
in which `IntVar` does it.

```tut:silent
import java.time.LocalDate
import scala.util.Try
import org.http4s.client.dsl.io._
```

```tut:book
object LocalDateVar {
  def unapply(str: String): Option[LocalDate] = {
    if (!str.isEmpty)
      Try(LocalDate.parse(str)).toOption
    else
      None
  }
}

def getTemperatureForecast(date: LocalDate): IO[Double] = IO(42.23)

val dailyWeatherService = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "weather" / "temperature" / LocalDateVar(localDate) =>
    Ok(getTemperatureForecast(localDate).map(s"The temperature on $localDate will be: " + _))
}

println(GET(uri"/weather/temperature/2016-11-05").flatMap(dailyWeatherService.orNotFound(_)).unsafeRunSync)
```

### Handling query parameters
A query parameter needs to have a `QueryParamDecoderMatcher` provided to
extract it. In order for the `QueryParamDecoderMatcher` to work there needs to
be an implicit `QueryParamDecoder[T]` in scope. `QueryParamDecoder`s for simple
types can be found in the `QueryParamDecoder` object. There are also
`QueryParamDecoderMatcher`s available which can be used to
return optional or validated parameter values.

In the example below we're finding query params named `country` and `year` and
then parsing them as a `String` and `java.time.Year`.

```tut:silent
import java.time.Year
import cats.data.ValidatedNel
```

```tut:book
object CountryQueryParamMatcher extends QueryParamDecoderMatcher[String]("country")

implicit val yearQueryParamDecoder: QueryParamDecoder[Year] =
  QueryParamDecoder[Int].map(Year.of)

object YearQueryParamMatcher extends QueryParamDecoderMatcher[Year]("year")

def getAverageTemperatureForCountryAndYear(country: String, year: Year): IO[Double] = ???

val averageTemperatureService = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "weather" / "temperature" :? CountryQueryParamMatcher(country) +& YearQueryParamMatcher(year)  =>
    Ok(getAverageTemperatureForCountryAndYear(country, year).map(s"Average temperature for $country in $year was: " + _))
}
```

To support a `QueryParamDecoderMatcher[Instant]`, consider `QueryParamCodec#instantQueryParamCodec`. That
outputs a `QueryParamCodec[Instant]`, which offers both a `QueryParamEncoder[Instant]` and `QueryParamDecoder[Instant]`.

```tut:silent
import java.time.Instant
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter
```

```tut:book
implicit val isoInstantCodec: QueryParamCodec[Instant] =
  QueryParamCodec.instantQueryParamCodec(DateTimeFormatter.ISO_INSTANT)

object IsoInstantParamMatcher extends QueryParamDecoderMatcher[Instant]("timestamp")
```

#### Optional query parameters

To accept an optional query parameter a `OptionalQueryParamDecoderMatcher` can be used.

```tut:silent
import java.time.Year
import org.http4s.client.dsl.io._
```

```tut:book
implicit val yearQueryParamDecoder: QueryParamDecoder[Year] =
  QueryParamDecoder[Int].map(Year.of)

object OptionalYearQueryParamMatcher extends OptionalQueryParamDecoderMatcher[Year]("year")

def getAverageTemperatureForCurrentYear: IO[String] = ???
def getAverageTemperatureForYear(y: Year): IO[String] = ???

val routes2 = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "temperature" :? OptionalYearQueryParamMatcher(maybeYear) =>
    maybeYear match {
      case None =>
        Ok(getAverageTemperatureForCurrentYear)
      case Some(year) =>
        Ok(getAverageTemperatureForYear(year))
    }
}
```

#### Missing required query parameters

A request with a missing required query parameter will fall through to the following `case` statements and may eventually return a 404. To provide contextual error handling, optional query parameters or fallback routes can be used.

#### Invalid query parameter handling

To validate query parsing you can use `ValidatingQueryParamDecoderMatcher` which returns a `ParseFailure` if the parameter cannot be decoded. Be careful not to return the raw invalid value in a `BadRequest` because it could be used for [Cross Site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) attacks.

```tut:book
implicit val yearQueryParamDecoder: QueryParamDecoder[Year] =
  QueryParamDecoder[Int].map(Year.of)

object YearQueryParamMatcher extends ValidatingQueryParamDecoderMatcher[Year]("year")

val routes = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "temperature" :? YearQueryParamMatcher(yearValidated) =>
    yearValidated.fold(
      parseFailures => BadRequest("unable to parse argument year"),
      year => Ok(getAverageTemperatureForYear(year))
    )
}
```
