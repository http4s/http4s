How do we know the server is running?  Let's create a client with
http4s to try our service.

A recap of the dependencies for this example, in case you skipped the [service] example. Ensure you have the following dependencies in your build.sbt:

```scala
scalaVersion := "2.11.8" // Also supports 2.10.x and 2.12.x

val http4sVersion = "{{< version "http4s.doc" >}}"

// Only necessary for SNAPSHOT releases
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-dsl" % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-blaze-server" % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-blaze-client" % http4sVersion
)
```

Then we create the [service] again so tut picks it up:

```tut:book:silent
import cats.effect._
import org.http4s._
import org.http4s.dsl.io._
import org.http4s.server.blaze._
```

Blaze needs a [[`ConcurrentEffect`]] instance, which is derived from
[[`ContextShift`]].  The following lines are not necessary if you are
in an [[`IOApp`]]:

```tut:book:silent
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global
implicit val cs: ContextShift[IO] = IO.contextShift(global)
```

Finish setting up our server:

```tut:book
val routes = HttpRoutes.of[IO] {
  case GET -> Root / "hello" / name =>
    Ok(s"Hello, $name.")
}

val server = BlazeBuilder[IO].bindHttp(8080, "localhost").mountService(routes, "/").resource
```

We'll start the server in the background.  The `IO.never` keeps it
running until we cancel the fiber.

```tut:book
val fiber = server.use(_ => IO.never).start.unsafeRunSync()
```


### Creating the client

A good default choice is the `BlazeClientBuilder`.  The
`BlazeClientBuilder` maintains a connection pool and speaks HTTP 1.x.

```tut:book:silent
import org.http4s.client.blaze._
import org.http4s.client._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
```

```tut:book
BlazeClientBuilder[IO](global).resource.use { client =>
  // use `client` here and return an `IO`.
  // the client will be acquired and shut down
  // automatically each time the `IO` is run.
  IO.unit
}
```

For the remainder of this tut, we'll use an alternate client backend
built on the standard `java.net` library client.  Unlike the blaze
client, it does not need to be shut down.  Like the blaze-client, and
any other http4s backend, it presents the exact same `Client`
interface!

It uses blocking IO and is less suited for production, but it is
highly useful in a REPL:

```tut:book:silent
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext
import java.util.concurrent._

val blockingEC = ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5))
val httpClient: Client[IO] = JavaNetClientBuilder(blockingEC).create
```

### Describing a call

To execute a GET request, we can call `expect` with the type we expect
and the URI we want:

```tut:book
val helloJames = httpClient.expect[String]("http://localhost:8080/hello/James")
```

Note that we don't have any output yet.  We have a `IO[String]`, to
represent the asynchronous nature of a client request.

Furthermore, we haven't even executed the request yet.  A significant
difference between a `IO` and a `scala.concurrent.Future` is that a
`Future` starts running immediately on its implicit execution context,
whereas a `IO` runs when it's told.  Executing a request is an
example of a side effect.  In functional programming, we prefer to
build a description of the program we're going to run, and defer its
side effects to the end.

Let's describe how we're going to greet a collection of people in
parallel:

```tut:book:silent
import cats._, cats.effect._, cats.implicits._
import org.http4s.Uri
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
```

```tut:book
def hello(name: String): IO[String] = {
  val target = Uri.uri("http://localhost:8080/hello/") / name
  httpClient.expect[String](target)
}

val people = Vector("Michael", "Jessica", "Ashley", "Christopher")

val greetingList = people.parTraverse(hello)
```

Observe how simply we could combine a single `F[String]` returned
by `hello` into a scatter-gather to return a `F[List[String]]`.

## Making the call

It is best to run your `F` "at the end of the world."  The "end of
the world" varies by context:

* In a command line app, it's your main method.
* In an `HttpApp[F]`, an `F[Response[F]]` is returned to be run by the
  server.
* Here in the REPL, the last line is the end of the world.  Here we go:

```tut:book
val greetingsStringEffect = greetingList.map(_.mkString("\n"))
greetingsStringEffect.unsafeRunSync
```

## Constructing a URI

Before you can make a call, you'll need a `Uri` to represent the endpoint you
want to access.

There are a number of ways to construct a `Uri`.

If you have a literal string, you can use `Uri.uri(...)`:

```tut:book
Uri.uri("https://my-awesome-service.com/foo/bar?wow=yeah")
```

This only works with literal strings because it uses a macro to validate the URI
format at compile-time.

Otherwise, you'll need to use `Uri.fromString(...)` and handle the case where
validation fails:

```tut:book
val validUri = "https://my-awesome-service.com/foo/bar?wow=yeah"
val invalidUri = "yeah whatever"

val uri: Either[ParseFailure, Uri] = Uri.fromString(validUri)

val parseFailure: Either[ParseFailure, Uri] = Uri.fromString(invalidUri)
```

You can also build up a URI incrementally, e.g.:

```tut:book
val baseUri = Uri.uri("http://foo.com")
val withPath = baseUri.withPath("/bar/baz")
val withQuery = withPath.withQueryParam("hello", "world")
```

## Middleware

Like the server [middleware], the client middleware is a wrapper around a
`Client` that provides a means of accessing or manipulating `Request`s
and `Response`s being sent.

### Included Middleware

Http4s includes some middleware Out of the Box in the `org.http4s.client.middleware`
package. These include:

* Following of redirect responses ([Follow Redirect])
* Retrying of requests ([Retry])
* Metrics gathering ([Metrics])
* Logging of requests ([Request Logger])
* Logging of responses ([Response Logger])
* Logging of requests and responses ([Logger])

### Metrics Middleware

Apart from the middleware mentioned in the previous section. There is, as well,
Out of the Box middleware for Dropwizard and Prometheus metrics

#### Dropwizard Metrics Middleware

To make use of this metrics middleware the following dependencies are needed:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-client" % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-dropwizard-metrics" % http4sVersion
)
```

We can create a middleware that registers metrics prefixed with a
provided prefix like this.

```tut:book:silent
import org.http4s.client.middleware.Metrics
import org.http4s.metrics.dropwizard.Dropwizard
import com.codahale.metrics.SharedMetricRegistries
```
```tut:book
implicit val clock = Clock.create[IO]
val registry = SharedMetricRegistries.getOrCreate("default")
val requestMethodClassifier = (r: Request[IO]) => Some(r.method.toString.toLowerCase)

val meteredClient = Metrics[IO](Dropwizard(registry, "prefix"), requestMethodClassifier)(httpClient)
```

A `classifier` is just a function Request[F] => Option[String] that allows
to add a subprefix to every metric based on the `Request`

#### Prometheus Metrics Middleware

To make use of this metrics middleware the following dependencies are needed:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-client" % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-prometheus-metrics" % http4sVersion
)
```

We can create a middleware that registers metrics prefixed with a
provided prefix like this.

```tut:book:silent
import org.http4s.client.middleware.Metrics
import org.http4s.metrics.prometheus.Prometheus
import io.prometheus.client.CollectorRegistry
```
```tut:book
implicit val clock = Clock.create[IO]
val registry = new CollectorRegistry()
val requestMethodClassifier = (r: Request[IO]) => Some(r.method.toString.toLowerCase)

val meteredClient = Metrics[IO](Prometheus(registry, "prefix"), requestMethodClassifier)(httpClient)
```


A `classifier` is just a function Request[F] => Option[String] that allows
to add a label to every metric based on the `Request`

## Examples

### Send a GET request, treating the response as a string

You can send a GET by calling the `expect` method on the client, passing a `Uri`:

```tut:book
httpClient.expect[String](Uri.uri("https://google.com/"))
```

If you need to do something more complicated like setting request headers, you
can build up a request object and pass that to `expect`:

```tut:book:silent
import org.http4s.client.dsl.io._
import org.http4s.headers._
import org.http4s.MediaType
```

```tut:book
val request = GET(
  Uri.uri("https://my-lovely-api.com/"),
  Authorization(Credentials.Token(AuthScheme.Bearer, "open sesame")),
  Accept(MediaType.application.json)
)

httpClient.expect[String](request)
```

### Post a form, decoding the JSON response to a case class

```tut:book
case class AuthResponse(access_token: String)

// See the JSON page for details on how to define this
implicit val authResponseEntityDecoder: EntityDecoder[IO, AuthResponse] = null

val postRequest = POST(
  Uri.uri("https://my-lovely-api.com/oauth2/token"),
  UrlForm(
    "grant_type" -> "client_credentials",
    "client_id" -> "my-awesome-client",
    "client_secret" -> "s3cr3t"
  )
)

httpClient.expect[AuthResponse](postRequest)
```

```tut:book:invisible
fiber.cancel.unsafeRunSync()
```

## Calls to a JSON API

Take a look at [json].

## Body decoding / encoding

The reusable way to decode/encode a request is to write a custom `EntityDecoder`
and `EntityEncoder`. For that topic, take a look at [entity].

If you prefer a more fine-grained approach, some of the methods take a `Response[F]
=> F[A]` argument, such as `fetch` or `get`, which lets you add a function which includes the
decoding functionality, but ignores the media type.

```scala
client.fetch(req) {
  case Status.Successful(r) => r.attemptAs[A].leftMap(_.message).value
  case r => r.as[String]
    .map(b => Left(s"Request $req failed with status ${r.status.code} and body $b"))
}
```

However, your function has to consume the body before the returned `F` exits.
Don't do this:

```scala
// will come back to haunt you
client.get[EntityBody]("some-url")(response => response.body)
```

Passing it to a `EntityDecoder` is safe.

```
client.get[T]("some-url")(response => jsonOf(response.body))
```

```tut:invisible
blockingEC.shutdown()
```
