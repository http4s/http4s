This release upgrades to [cats-parse v1.0.0](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-parse/releases/tag/v1.0.0) which may trigger eviction errors in your build. The cats-parse 1.x series is 100% binary-compatible with the cats-parse 0.3.x series, so it is safe to ignore the eviction errors in this case.

Be aware that versions of these modules will be untethered from the core version they depend on.
* These modules may not be republished with each core patch release, but will still work on the latest 0.23 core.
* Some of these modules will see breaking releases to upgrade their integrated dependencies, based on the 0.23 core.  These upgrades could previously not be undertaken without a breaking change of the entire http4s ecosystem.
* All modules will continue to adhere to [early semver](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/02/16/preventing-version-conflicts-with-versionscheme.html#early-semver-and-sbt-version-policy).
* We recommend [sbt-updates](https://github.com/rtimush/sbt-updates) or [Scala Steward](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward) for all your dependencies, and heeding SBT's eviction warnings.
* We would like to welcome new maintainers to help out on each of these modules.  Look for the "help wanted" label in these repos.

    * Breaking changes
        * [#5348](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5348): Scala.js only: remove `JavaNetClientBuilder`.  It already failed to link, and now it will fail to compile.
    * Bug fixes
        * [#5349](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5349): Fix deadlocks in `Retry` and `FollowRedirect` middlewares.  We no longer attempt to acquire a second connection before releasing the first, potentially starving the connection pool.

* Dependency updates
    * scalajs-1.7.1

# v0.22.7 (2021-10-12)

This is a routine maintenance release.  It is binary compatible with the v0.22.x series and includes the changes in v0.21.31.

* netty-4.1.69.Final
* scalacheck-effect-1.0.3

# v0.21.31 (2021-10-11)

* http4s-core
    * Compatibility
        * [#5291](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5291): Undeprecate `Headers.apply`.  Something similar exists in 0.22.

* http4s-blaze-client
    * Compatibility
        * [#5291](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5291): Add `org.http4s.blaze.client.BlazeClientBuilder` to `org.http4s.client.blaze.BlazeClientBuilder`.  In 0.22, the alias becomes the canonical name for consistency with the other backends.

# v1.0.0-M28 (2021-10-06)

This is the latest development milestone in the 1.x series.  It is not binary compatible with previous milestones.

The http4s-dom-core, http4s-dom-fetch-client, and http4s-dom-service-worker modules have been moved to the [http4s-dom repo](https://github.com/http4s/http4s-dom) and are now on their own release cycle.

* Various modules
    * Noteworthy refactoring
        * [#5303](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5303): Many of the changes on the 1.x line were backported to 0.23.x.  This resynchronized those branches for continuing merges.  Nothing significant should have changed here that isn't already noted in 0.23.5.

* http4s-core
    * Breaking changes
        * [#5328](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5328): `HttpVersion#copy` is removed from the public API.  It was deprecated in 0.22.6.

* http4s-server
    * Breaking changes
        * [#5327](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5327): `WebSocketBuilder2` is renamed back to `WebSocketBuilder`.  A deprecated alias is left as `WebSocketBuilder` to aid migration.

# v0.23.5 (2021-10-06)

This is a maintenance release.  It is binary compatible with 0.23.4, and includes the changes in 0.22.6.

Scala.js support is backported for a large subset of the modules present in 1.0.
Additional Scala.js-only modules for using http4s in the browser have been spun off as https://github.com/http4s/http4s-dom.

* http4s-core
    * Cross Builds
        * [#5298](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5298): Add support for Scala.js
    * Deprecations
        * [#5226](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5226): Migrate to the `fs2.io.file` APIs in `EntityDecoder`, `StaticFile`, and `Part`.

* http4s-blaze-server
    * Bug fixes
        * [#5152](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5152): Pass a `WebSocketBuilder`, now named `WebSocketBuilder2`, when adding an `HttpApp`.  This, combined with the new `imapK` method, lets web socket applications vary the local effect.  Previously, this threw a `ClassCastException`.

* http4s-blaze-client
    * Enhancements
        * [#5201](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5201): Adds an `BlazeClientBuilder.apply` method that uses the `ExecutionContext` from the `Async[F]` instance.  The old constructor that required an explicit `ExecutionContext` is now deprecated.  Users who need a custom `ExecutionContext` for blaze should call `withExecutionContext`.

    * Enhancements
        * [#5219](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5219): Add support for Unix sockets.  This works on Linux and Darwin, but not on Windows. Use the new `withUnixSocketConfig` method on `EmberServerBuilder` to bind to an `fs2.io.net.unixsocket.UnixSocketAddress`.

* http4s-ember-client
    * Cross Builds
        * [#5298](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5298): Add support for Scala.js
    * Enhancements
        * [#5219](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5219): Add support for Unix sockets.  This works on Linux and Darwin, but not on Windows.  Use the new `UnixSocket` middleware to route requests to an `fs2.io.net.unixsocket.UnixSocketAddress`.

* Dependency versions
    * fs2-3.1.4
    * ip4s-3.0.4

# v0.22.6 (2021-10-06)

* http4s-core
    * Enhancements
        * [#5189](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5189): Add `Order[HttpDate]` and `Hash[HttpDate]` instance
        * [#5265](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5265): Add `Ordering[QValue]` instance
        * [#5279](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5279): Add constants for `HTTP/3`, `HTTP/2` (deprecating `HTTP/2.0`), and `HTTP/0.9`.
        * [#5294](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5294): Implement `DNT` header
        * [#5296](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5296): Add `Accept-Post` header
    * Deprecation
        * [#5260](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5260): Deprecate `HttpVersion#copy`, which circumvents validation and could create out-of-bounds HTTP protocol versions.
        * [#5253](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5253): Deprecate custom status reason phrases.  They are a security risk for something that not all backends support and the spec does not require us to support.
        * [#5331](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5331): Deprecate `Status.apply`, which does not validate the code. Use `fromInt` instead.
    * Notable refactoring
        * [#5139](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5139): Add dependency on new `http4s-crypto` library, which abstracts the target platform.  All of its uses should be internal.  Scala.js support is added in later branches, but this aids maintenance.
        * [#5308](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5308): Use `Uri.unsafeFromString` in `Uri` literal macro to ease WartRemover usage.

* http4s-laws
    * Deprecation
        * [#5274](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5274): Deprecate `ArbitraryInstances`, which was redundant with the `arbitrary` object.  The latter is packaged consistently with Cats' arbitraries.

* http4s-server
    * Enhancements
        * [#5323](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5323): In `CORSPolicy`, add `withAllowHeadersStatic`, which supports a static list of `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` whether the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` values match or not.

* http4s-blaze-client
    * Semantic change
        * [#5032](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5032): Wrap `EOF` when borrowing a dead connection in a `java.net.SocketException` with information on which host failed.

* http4s-ember-client
    * Enhancements
        * [#5271](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5271): Eliminate exception allocation on the parser hot path
        * [#5290](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5290): Retry on `IOException` with `"Connection reset by peer"` or `"Broken pipe"` in the message

* http4s-ember-server
    * Semantic change
        * [#5286](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5286): On `requestHeaderTimeout` and `idleTimeout`, close the connection without rendering a `500 Internal Server Error` response.  The HTTP/1.1 spec is not prescrptive on this matter, but this behavior is more consistent with prevaling usage in http4s and a sampling of other servers.  Furthermore, an empty response is retriable (assuming request idempotence) by clients, whereas a `500 Internal Server Error` is not.

* Enhancements
    * [#5271](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5271): Eliminate exception allocation on the parser hot path

This release includes security patches for [GHSA-5vcm-3xc3-w7x3](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-5vcm-3xc3-w7x3) for blaze-client, blaze-server, ember-client, ember-server, and jetty-client.  It forward-merges 0.23.4.

* http4s-dom-fetch-client
    * Enhancements
        * [#5101](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5101): Add a request timeout and new `FetchOptions` to configure the fetch client.

* http4s-ember-server
    * Bugfixes
        * [#5138](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5138): Correctly populate the `SecureSession` response attribute.

* Dependency updates
    * scodec-bits-1.1.28

# v0.21.28 (2021-09-02)

This is a bugfix to yesterday's patch.  It is not a security issue, but a correctness issue.

This release is binary compatible with 0.21.x.

* http4s-server
    * Breaking changes
        * [#5144](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5144): In the `CORS` middleware, respond to preflight `OPTIONS` requests with a 200 status.  It was previously passing through to the wrapped `Http`, most of which won't respond to `OPTIONS`.  The breaking change is that the constraint is promoted from `Functor` to `Applicative`.  The `Functor` version is left for binary compatibility with a runtime warning.

# v1.0.0-M25 (2021-09-01)

This is the latest development release.  No binary compatibility is promised yet.  Includes all changes in v0.23.2.

    * Enhancements
        * [#5085](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5085): Make `EntityEncoder`s for `File`, `Path`, and `InputStream` implicit.  Since 0.23, they no longer require an explicit `Blocker` parameter, using Cats-Effect 3's runtime instead.

* http4s-blaze-server
    * Bug fixes
        * [#5118](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5118): Don't block the `TickWheelExecutor` on cancellation.  In-flight responses are canceled when a connection shuts down.  If the response cancellation hangs, it blocks the `TickWheelScheduler` thread.  When this thread blocks, subsequent scheduled events are not processed, and memory leaks with each newly scheduled event.
    * Enhancements
        * [#4782](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/4782): Use `Async[F].executionContext` as a default `ExecutionContext` in `BlazeServerBuilder`.

* http4s-ember-server
    * [#5106](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5106): Demote noisy `WebSocket connection terminated with exception` message to trace-level logging on broken pipes.  This relies on exception message parsing and may not work well in all locales.

# v0.22.3 (2021-09-01)

This release includes a security patch to  [GHSA-52cf-226f-rhr6](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-52cf-226f-rhr6), along with all changes in 0.21.26 and 0.21.27.

Binary compatible with 0.22.2 series, with the exception of static forwarders in `HttpApp.apply`, `HttpApp.local`.  Unless you are calling `HttpApp` from a language other than Scala, you are not affected.

* http4s-core
    * Binary breaking changes
        * [#5071](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5071): Weakens constraints on `HttpApp.apply` and `HttpApp.local` from `Sync` to `Defer`.  This change is technically binary breaking, but will only affect static methods called via interop from a language other than Scala.
    * Semantic changes
        * [#5073](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5073): `withEntity` now replaces any existing headers with the same name with the headers from the `EntityEncoder`.  In v0.21, known single headers were replaced and recurring headers were appended.  Beginning in 0.22.0, everything was appended, which commonly resulted in duplicate `Content-Type` headers.  There is no longer a global registry of headers to infer singleton vs. recurring semantics, but in practice, `EntityEncoder` headers are single, so this is more correct and more similar to the pre-0.22 behavior.
    * Bugfixes
        * [#5070](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5070): Fix `Accept-Language` parser on the wildcard (`*`) tag with a quality value
        * [#5105](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5105): Parse `UTF-8` charset tag on `Content-Disposition` filenames case-insensitively. This was a regression from 0.21.
    * Enhancements
        * [#5042](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5042): Add a modeled header for `Access-Control-Request-Method`.

        * [#5023](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5023): Parameterize the signature algorithm in the OAuth 1 middleware.  HMAC-SHA256 and HMAC-SHA512 are now supported in addition to HMAC-SHA1.

* http4s-server
    * Bugfixes
        * [#5056](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5056): In `GZip` middleware, don't add a `Content-Encoding` header if the response type doesn't support an entity.
    * Enhancements

    * Bugfixes
        * [#5126](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5126): Upgrades to a Blaze version that uses a monotonic timer in the `TickWheelExecutor`.  This will improve scheduling correctness in the presence of an erratic clock.

* http4s-blaze-server

        * [#5043](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5043): Fix several bugs where a body stream silenty ends if the peer closes its end of the socket without finishing writing. This now raises an error.

* http4s-ember-client
    * Bugfixes
        * [#5041](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5041): Don't keep alive HTTP/1.0 connections without a `Connection: keep-alive` header.

* http4s-dsl
    * Enhancements
        * [#5063](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5063): Added `->>` infix extractor for a resource-oriented view of routing. Use this to define resource paths only once, and generate proper `405` responses with a correct `Allow` header when the method is not handled.

* Dependency updates
    * blaze-0.15.2
    * netty-4.1.67

# v0.21.27 (2021-08-31)

This is a security release.  It is binary compatible with the 0.21.x series.

* http4s-server
    * Security patches [GHSA-52cf-226f-rhr6](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-52cf-226f-rhr6):
        * Deprecates `apply` method that takes a `CORSConfig`, and `httpRoutes` anad `httpApp` that take no config.  The default configuration disables most actual CORS protection, and has several deficiences even when properly configured.  See the GHSA for a full discussion.  tl;dr: start from `CORS.policy`.
        * The deprecated implementation now ignores the `allowCredentials` setting when `anyOrigin` is true, and logs a warning.  If you insist on using the deprecated version, old behavior can be restored by setting `anyOrigin` to false and `allowOrigins` to `Function.const(true)`.
        * No longer renders an `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false` headerFor safety, the `allowCredentials` setting is now Please see the GHSA for a full discussion.
        * The replacement implementation, created from the new `CORS.policy`, additionally fixes the following defects:
        * No longer returns a `403 Forbidden` response when CORS checks fail.  The enforcement point of CORS is the user agent.  Any failing checks just suppress CORS headers in the http4s response.
        * Add  `Access-Control-Request-Headers` to the `Vary` header on preflight responses when it can affect the response. This is important for caching.
        * Validate the  `Access-Control-Request-Headers`, and return no CORS headers if any of the headers are disallowed.
        * Remote `Vary: Access-Control-Request-Method` and `Access-Control-Max-Age` headers from non-preflight responses.  These are only relevant in preflight checks.

* http4s-blaze-server
    * Bugfixes
        * [#5125](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/5125): Upgrade to a blaze that uses monotonic time in the `TickWheelExecutor`. This is unrelated to the GHSA, but guards against a theoretical scheduling problem if the system clock is erratic.

* Dependency updates
    * blaze-0.14.18

# v0.21.26 (2021-08-12)

The 0.21 series is no longer actively maintained by the team, but we'll continue to entertain binary compatible patches.  All users are still encouraged to upgrade to 0.22 (for Cats-Effect 2) or 0.23 (the latest stable series, on Cats-Effect 3).

# v1.0.0-M24 (2020-08-07)

This release adds support for Scala.js, including an Ember client and server, serverless apps, a browser client backed by fetch, and browser service worker apps.

This is the first significant divergence from the 0.23 line since it was forked off an earlier 1.0 milestone.  It is not binary compatible with 0.23.x or 1.0.0-M23.

Includes all changes through 0.23.1.

Connections can be terminated on the server side while idling in our pool, which does not manifest until we attempt to read the response.  This is now raised as a `java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException`.   A `retryPolicy` configuration has been added to the `EmberClientBuilder`.

# v1.0.0-M23 (2021-05-26)

Functionally equivalent to v0.23.0-RC1. Keeps the 1.0 milestones current as we continue our roadmap. Includes the [vulnerability fix](https://github.com/http4s/http4s-ghsa-6h7w-fc84-x7p6) to `StaticFile.fromUrl`.

# v0.23.0-RC1 (2021-05-26)

Includes the changes of v0.22.0-RC1, including the [vulnerability fix](https://github.com/http4s/http4s-ghsa-6h7w-fc84-x7p6) to `StaticFile.fromUrl`.

* http4s-core
    * Breaking changes
        * [#4884](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/4884): Use `Monad` instead of `Defer` constraints on `HttpApp`, `HttpRoutes`, `AuthedRoutes`, `ContextRoutes`, and related syntax. This avoids diverging implicits when only a `Concurrent` constraint is available in Cats-Effect-3.
    * Noteworthy refactoring
        * [#4773](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/4787): Refactor the internals of the `Multipart` parser.

# v0.22.0-RC1 (2021-05-26)

Includes the changes of 0.21.24, including the [vulnerability fix](https://github.com/http4s/http4s-ghsa-6h7w-fc84-x7p6) to `StaticFile.fromUrl`.

* http4s-core
    * Breaking changes
        * [#4787](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/4787): Various header selection refinements:
        * `Header.Select#toRaw` now takes an `F[A]` and returns a `NonEmptyList[Header.Raw]`. This is necessary because headers without a `Semigroup` (e.g., `Set-Cookie`) can't be combined into a single header value.
        * The old `Header.Select#toRaw` is renamed to `toRaw1`.  This version still accepts a single value and returns a single raw header.
        * `Header.Select#from` now returns an `Option[Ior[NonEmptyList[ParseFailure], NonEmptyList[A]]]`. The `Ior` lets us return both a value and "warnings" when a repeating header contains both valid and invalid entries.
        * Add `Headers#getWithWarnings` to return the `Ior` result.
        * [#4788](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/4788): Extend `ServerSentEvent` with comments.  The `data` field is now optional. `retry` is changed from a `Long` to a `FiniteDuration`.  `data` spanning multiple lines are now rendered as multiple `data:` fields per the spec.
    * Bugfixes
        * [#4873](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/4873): Catch exceptions in `ParseResult.fromParser`. Don't throw when parsing a media range in the `Content-Type` parser.

* Dependency updates
    * blaze-0.15.1
    * circe-0.14.1
    * play-json-2.9.2 (downgrade)

# v0.21.24 (2021-05-26)

0.21 is EOL.  Bugfixes and community submissions will be considered for discretionary releases, but the development team will now focus on later branches.

Contains a vulnerability fix for `StaticFile.fromUrl`.

* http4s-blaze-core
    * Vulnerability fixes
        * [GHSA-6h7w-fc84-x7p6](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-6h7w-fc84-x7p6): Don't leak the existence of a directory serverside when using `StaticFile.fromUrl` with non-file URLs.
    * Enhancements
        * [#4880](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/4880): Handle exceptions when the tick wheel executor is shutdown as a warning instead of a stack trace error.

* http4s-ember-client
    * Enhancements

There are several package renames in the backends.  To help, we've provided a Scalafix:

1. Add to your `projects/plugins.sbt`:

   ```scala
   addSbtPlugin("ch.epfl.scala" % "sbt-scalafix" % "0.9.28")
   ```

2. Run the following:

   ```sh
   sbt ";scalafixEnable; scalafix github:http4s/http4s/v0_22"
   ```

    * Breaking: New header model

      This release brings a new model for headers.  The model based on subtyping and general type projection used through http4s-0.21 is replaced by a `Header` typeclass.

        * There is no longer a `Header.Parsed`.  All headers are stored in `Headers` as `Header.Raw`.
        * `Header.Raw` is no longer a subtype of `Header`.  `Header` is now a typeclass.
        * New modeled headers can be registered simply by providing an instance of `Header`. The global registry, `HttpHeaderParser`, is gone.
        * `Headers` are created and `put` via a `Header.ToRaw` magnet pattern.  Instances of `ToRaw` include `Raw`, case classes with a `Header` instance, `(String, String)` tuples, and `Foldable[Header.ToRaw]`.  This makes it convenient to create headers from types that don't share a subtyping relationship, and preserves a feel mostly compatible with the old `Headers.of`.
        * `HeaderKey` is gone. To retrieve headers from the `Headers`, object, pass the type in `[]` instead of `()` (e.g., `headers.get[Location]`).
        * `from` no longer exists on the companion object of modeled headers.  Use the `get[X]` syntax.
        * `unapply` no longer exists on most companion objects of modeled headers.  This use dto be an alias to `from`.
        * "Parsed" headers are no longer memoized, so calling `headers.get[X]` twice will reparse any header with a name matching `Header[X].name` a second time.  It is not believed that headers were parsed multiple times often in practice.  Headers are still not eagerly parsed, so performance is expected to remain about the same.
        * The `Header` instance carries a phantom type, `Recurring` or `Single`.  This information replaces the old `HeaderKey.Recurring` and `HeaderKey.Singleton` marker classes, and is used to determine whether we return the first header or search for multiple headers.
        * Given `h1: Headers` and `h2.Headers`, `h1.put(h2)` and `h1 ++ h2` now replace all headers in `h1` whose key appears in `h2`.  They previously replaced only singleton headers and appended recurring headers.  This behavior was surprising to users, and required the global registry.
        * An `add` operation is added, which requires a value with a `HeaderKey.Recurring` instance.  This operation appends to any existing headers.
        * `Headers#toList` is gone, but `Headers#headers` returns a `List[Header.Raw]`. The name was changed to call attention to the fact that the type changed to raw headers.

Partial publish after build failure

# v0.22.0-M1 (2021-01-24)

This is a new series, forked from main before Cats-Effect 3 support was merged.  It is binary incompatible with 0.21, but contains several changes that will be necessary for Scala 3 (Dotty) support. It builds on all the changes from v1.0.0-M1 through v1.0.0-M10, which are not echoed here.

The headline change is that all parboiled2 parsers have been replaced with cats-parse.

* Should I switch?

* Users who had been tracking the 1.0 series, but are not prepared for Cats Effect 3, should switch to this series.
* Users who wish to remain on the bleeding edge, including Cats Effect 3, should continue track the 1.0 series.
* Users who need a stable release should remain on the 0.21 series for now.

* http4s-core
    * Breaking changes
        * [#3855](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3855): All parboiled2 parsers are replaced by cats-parse.  parboiled2 was not part of the public API, nor are our cats-parse parsers.  Users may observe a difference in the error messages and subtle semantic changes.  We've attempted to minimize them, but this is a significant underlying change.

* Internals

    Should not affect end users, but noted just in case:

    * [#3964](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3964): Replace `cats.implicits._` imports with `cats.syntax.all._`. Should not be user visible.
    * [#3963](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3963), [#3983](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3983): Port several tests to MUnit. This helps with CI health.

  [info]   at org.http4s.client.Client$.$anonfun$fromHttpApp$2(Client.scala:246)

  A test dependency upgrade evicted our declared cats-effect-2.2.0 dependency, so we built against a newer version than we advertise in our POM.  Fixed by downgrading the test dependency and inspecting the classpath.  Tooling will be added to avoid repeat failures.

# v0.21.12 (2020-11-25)

* Bugfixes
    * http4s-core
        * [#3911](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3911): Support raw query strings. Formerly, all query strings were stored as a vector of key-value pairs, which was lossy in the percent-encoding of sub-delimiter characters (e.g., '+' vs '%2B').  Queries constructed with `.fromString` will be rendered as-is, for APIs that assign special meaning to sub-delimiters.
        * [#3921](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3921): Fix rendering of URIs with colons. This was a regression in v0.21.9.

    * http4s-dsl
        * [#3876](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3876): Replace `dsl.Http4sDsl.Path` with `core.Uri.Path`. The new `Path` in 1.0 is rich enough to support the DSL's routing needs, and this eliminates a conversion between models on every `->` extractor.  This change is source compatible in typical extractions.

    * http4s-circe
        * [#3891](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3891): Encode JSON streams in their constituent chunks instead of a chunk-per-`Json`. This can significantly reduce the network flushes on most backends.
    * http4s-dsl
        * [#3844](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3844): Add `MatrixVar` extractor for [Matrix URIs](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html)
    * http4s-async-http-client
        * [#3859](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3859): Add `AsyncHttpClient.apply` method that takes an already constructed async-http-client. This is useful for keeping a handle on bespoke of the client, such as its stats. Adds a functional `AsyncHttpClientStats` wrapper around the native stats class.

* Security
    * [GHSA-8hxh-r6f7-jf45](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/security/advisories/GHSA-8hxh-r6f7-jf45): The version of Netty used by async-http-client is affected by [CVE-2020-11612](https://app.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-IONETTY-564897).  A server we connect to with http4s-async-http-client could theoretically respond with a large or malicious compressed stream and exhaust memory in the client JVM. This does not affect any release in the 1.x series.

~~# v1.0.0-M1 (2020-06-25)~~

Did not publish successfully from tag.

# v0.21.5 (2020-06-24)

This release is fully backward compatible with 0.21.4.

* New modules
    * [#3372](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3372): `http4s-scalafix`: starting with this release, we have integrated Scalafix rules into the build.  All our Scalafix rules will be published as both snapshots and with core releases.  The http4s-scalafix version is equivalent to the output version of the scalafix rules.  The scalafix rules are intended to assist migrations with deprecations (within this series) and breaking changes (in the upcoming push to 1.0).

* Bugfixes
    * [#3476](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3476): Fix crash of `GZip` client middleware on responses to `HEAD` requests
    * [#3488](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3488): Don't call `toString` on input of `ResponseLogger` on cancellation. The input is usually a `Request`. We filter a set of default sensitive headers in `Request#toString`, but custom headers can also be sensitive and could previously be leaked by this middleware.
    * [#3521](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3521): In async-http-client, raise errors into response body stream when thrown after we've begun streaming. Previously, these errors were logged, but the response body was truncated with no value indicating failure.
    * [#3520](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3520): When adding a query parameter to a `Uri` with a blank query string (i.e., the URI ends in '?'), don't prepend it with a `'&'` character. This is important in OAuth1 signing.
    * [#3518](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3518): Fix `Cogen[ContentCoding]` in the testing arbitraries to respect the case-insensitivity of the coding field.
    * [#3501](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3501): Explicitly use `Locale.ENGLISH` when comparing two `ContentCoding`'s coding fields. This only matters if your default locale has different casing semantics than English for HTTP token characters.

* Deprecations
    * [#3441](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3441): Deprecate `org.http4s.util.threads`, which is not related to HTTP
    * [#3442](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3442): Deprecate `org.http4s.util.hashLower`, which is not related to HTTP
    * [#3466](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3466): Deprecate `util.decode`, which may loop infinitely on certain malformed input.  Deprecate `Media#bodyAsText` and `EntityDecoder.decodeString`, which may loop infinitely for charsets other than UTF-8.  The latter two methods are replaced by `Media#bodyText` and `EntityDecoder.decodeText`.
    * [#3372](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3372): Deprecate `Client.fetch(request)(f)` in favor of `Client#run(request).use(f)`. This is to highlight the dangers of using `F.pure` or similar as `f`, which gives access to the body after the client may have recycled the connection.  For training and code reviewing purposes, it's easier to be careful with `Resource#use` than convenience methods like `fetch` that are `use` in disguise. This change can be fixed with our new http4s-scalafix.

* Enhancements
    * [#3286](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3286): Add `httpRoutes` constructor for `Autoslash middleware`
    * [#3382](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3382): Use more efficient String compiler in `EntityDecoder[F, String]`
    * [#3439](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3439): Add `Hash[Method]` instance. See also [#3490](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3490).

    * [#3513](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3513): Add `httpRoutes` constructor for `DefaultHead`. Note that `httpApp` is not relevant.
    * [#3497](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3497): Add `logBodyText` functions to `Logger` middleware to customize the logging of the bodies

* Deprecations
    * [#3330](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3330): Deprecate `BlazeServerBuilder#apply()` in favor of passing an `ExecutionContext` explicitly.  Formerly, `ExecutionContext.global` was referenced by the default builder, and would spin up its thread pool even if the app never used the global execution context.
    * [#3361](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3361): Deprecate `org.http4s.util.bug`, which is for internal use only.

# v0.21.1 (2020-02-13)

This release is fully backward compatible with v0.21.0, and includes all the changes from v0.20.18.

* Bug fixes
    * [#3192](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3192): Parse `SameSite` cookie attribute and values case insensitively.

* Enhancements
    * [#3185](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3185): In blaze-server, recover `EOF` to close the connection instead of catching it. This reduces log noise in Cats Effect implementations that wrap uncaught exceptions.

* Dependency updates
    * jawn-fs2-1.0.0: We accidentally released v0.21.0 against an RC of jawn-fs2. This is fully compatible.

# v0.20.19 (2020-02-13)

This release is fully backward compatible with 0.20.18.

* Bugfixes
    * [#3199](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3199): When `Uri#withPath` is called without a slash and an authority is defined, add a slash to separate them.

* Enhancements
    * [#3199](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3199):
    * New `addSegment` alias for `Uri#/`
    * New `Uri#addPath` function, which splits the path segments and adds each, URL-encoded.

# v0.20.18 (2020-02-13)

This release is fully backward compatible with 0.20.17.

* Bugfixes
    * [#3178](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3178): In `TomcatBuilder`, use the correct values for the `clientAuth` connector attribute.
    * [#3184](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3184):
    * Parse cookie attribute names case insensitively.
    * Preserve multiple extended cookie attributes, delimited by a `';'`
    * Support cookie domains with a leading `'.'`

* Enhancements
    * [#3190](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3190): Remove reflection from initialization of `HttpHeaderParser`. This allows modeled headers to be parsed when running on Graal. The change is fully transparent on the JVM.

* Dependency updates
    * argonaut-6.2.4
    * async-http-client-2.10.5
    * tomcat-9.0.31

# v0.21.0 (2020-02-09)

This release is fully compatible with 0.21.0-RC4.  Future releases in the 0.21.x series will maintain binary compatibility with this release.  All users on the 0.20.x or earlier are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

* Dependency updates
* argonaut-6.2.4
* circe-0.13.0

# v0.21.0-RC5 (2020-02-08)

This release is binary compatible with 0.21.0-RC4.

We announced this as built on circe-0.13.0.  That was not correct, but is fixed in 0.21.0.

* Enhancements
    * [#3148](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3148): Add `HttpRoutes.strict` and `ContextRoutes.strict` for routes that require only an `Applicative`, at the cost of evaluating `combineK`ed routes strictly.

* Dependency updates
    * async-http-client-2.10.5
    * cats-effect-2.1.1
    * scalatags-0.8.5

# v0.21.0-RC4 (2020-02-04)

This release is binary incompatible with 0.21.0-RC2, but is source compatible.

* Breaking changes
    * Binary
        * [#3145](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3145): Relax constraints from `Effect` to `Sync` in `resourceService`, `fileService`, and `webjarService`.

# v0.21.0-RC3 (2020-02-03)

This release is binary incompatible with 0.21.0-RC2, but should be source compatible, with deprecations.

* Breaking changes
    * Binary
        * [#3126](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3126): Remove unnecessary `Applicative` constraints from http4s-circe
        * [#3124](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3124): Relax constraints from `Effect` to `Sync` in `FileService`.
        * [#3136](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3136): In `WebSocketBuilder`, add `filterPingPongs` parameter, default true.  When false, `send` and `receive` will see pings and pongs sent by the client.  The server still responds automatically to pings.  This change should be transparent to existing users.
        * [#3138](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3124): Remove unnecessary `Applicative` constraints on `EntityEncoder` instances in several modules.
    * Semantic
        * [#3139](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3139): Changes `Router` to find the longest matching prefix by path segments rather than character-by-character.  This is arguably a bug fix.  The old behavior could cause unexpected matches, is inconsistent with the servlet mappings that inspired `Router`, and is unlikely to have been intentionally depended on.
    * Deprecation
        * [#3134](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3132): Deprecate `JettyBuilder#withSSLContext` in favor of new methods in favor of new `withSslContext*` methods.
        * [#3132](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3132): Deprecate `BlazeServerBuilder#withSSLContext` and `BlazeServerBuilder#withSSL` in favor of new `withSslContext*` methods.
        * [#3140](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3140): Deprecate `JettyBuilder#withSSL`, to match `BlazeServerBuilder`. It's still necessary in Tomcat, which doesn't take a `ServletContext`.  Deprecate `SSLConfig`, `KeyStoreBits`, and `SSLContextBits`, which had already been removed from public API.

* Bugfixes
    * [#3140](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3140): In `TomcatBuilder`, fix mapping of `SSLClientAuthMode` to Tomcat's connector API.

* Enhancements
    * [#3134](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3132): In `JettyBuilder`, add `withSslContext` and `withSslContextAndParameters` to permit full control of `SSLParameters`.  Add `withoutSsl`.
    * [#3132](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3132): In `BlazeBuilder`, add `withSslContext` and `withSslContextAndParameters` to permit full control of `SSLParameters`.  Add `withoutSsl`.

# v0.21.0-RC2 (2020-01-27)

* Breaking changes
    * Binary and source
        * [#3110](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3110): Change `MessageFailure#toHttpResponse` to return a `Response[F]` instead of an `F[Response[F]]`, and relax constraints accordingly. Drops the `inHttpResponse` method.
        * [#3107](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3107): Add `covary[F[_]]` method to `Media` types.  Should not break your source unless you have your own `Media` subclass, which you shouldn't.
    * Binary only
        * [#3098](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3098): Update `MimeDB` from IANA registry.
    * Deprecation
        * [#3087](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3087): Deprecate the public http4s-testing module.  This was mostly Specs2 matchers, the majority of which block threads.  This is not to be confused with http4s-laws, which depends only on Discipline and is still maintained.

* Bugfixes
    * [#3105](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3105): Fix "cannot have more than one pending write request" error in blaze-server web sockets.
    * [#3115](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3115): Handle BOM at the head of a chunk in `decode`.

* Enhancements
    * [#3106](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3106): Interrupt response body in `DefaultHead` middleware. This optimization saves us from draining a potentially large response body that, because `HEAD` is a safe method, should not have side effects.
    * [#3095](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3095): Add `Request#asCurl` method to render a request as a curl command.  Renders the method, URI, and headers, but not yet the body.

# v0.20.17 (2020-01-25)

This release is fully compatible with 0.20.16.

* Bugfixes
    * [#3105](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3105): Fix "cannot have more than one pending write request" error in blaze-server web sockets.

# v0.21.0-RC1 (2020-01-21)

* Breaking changes
    * [#3012](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3012): Use `HttpApp` instead of `HttpRoutes` in `Http4sServlet`. The servlet builders themselves retain compatibility.
    * [#3078](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3078): Wrap Java exceptions in `ConnectionFailure` when a blaze-client fails to establish a connection. This preserves information about which host could not be connected to.
    * [#3062](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3062): http4s' JSON support is now built on jawn-1.0.0, which is a binary break from jawn-0.14.x.  This comes with a bump to circe-0.13.  Most circe-0.13 modules are binary compatible with circe-0.12, but note that circe-parser is not.
    * [#3055](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3055): Add fs2-io's TLS support to ember-client.  The `sslContext: Option[(ExecutionContext, SSLContext)]` argument is replaced by a `tlsContext: Option[TLSContext]`.`

    * [#3031](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3031): Relax `Router.apply` constraint from `Sync` to `Monad`
    * [#2821](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2821): Add `Media` supertype of `Message` and `Part`, so multipart parts can use `EntityDecoder`s
    * [#3021](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3021): Relax `Throttle.apply` constraint from `Sync` to `Monad`. Add a `mapK` operation to `TokenBucket`.
    * [#3056](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3056): Add `streamJsonArrayEncoder*` operations to circe support, to encode a `Stream` of `A` to a JSON array, given an encoder for `A`.
    * [#3053](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3053): Remove unneeded `Functor[G]` constraint on `HeaderEcho.apply`.
    * [#3054](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3054): Add `SameSite` cookie support

    * [#3069](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3069): Add `ContextMiddleware.const` function
    * [#3070](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3070): Add `NonEmptyTraverse` instance to `ContextRequest`
    * [#3060](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3060): Stop mixing context bounds and implicits in `CirceInstances`.
    * [#3024](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3024): Add `withQueryParams` and `withMultiValueQueryParams` to `QueryOps`
    * [#3092](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/3092): Add TLS support to ember-server via fs2-io.

# v0.21.0-M2 (2019-07-09)

This release drops support for Scala 2.11 and adds the `http4s-ember-server` and `http4s-ember-client` backends.  Ember is new and experimental, but we intend for it to become the reference implementation.  Notably, it only requires a `Concurrent` constraint.

    * [#2704](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2704): Remove unused `Sync` constraint on `Part.formData`.

* Breaking changes
    * [#2654](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2654): Extract an http4s-laws module from http4s-testing, with no dependency on Specs2.  The arbitraries, laws, and tests are now laid out in a similar structure to cats and cats-effect.

# v0.20.0 (2019-04-22)

* Announcements
    * blaze-client stability
      We are declaring this a stable release, though we acknowledge a handful of lingering issues with the blaze-client.  Users who have trouble with the blaze backend are invited to try the async-http-client, okhttp, or jetty-client backends instead.

    * Scala 2.13 compatibility
      When our dependencies are published for Scala 2.13.0-RC1, we will publish for it and drop support for Scala 2.13.0-M5.  We know it's out there, and we're as anxious as you.

    * cats-2 and http4s-0.21
      Cats 2.0 is expected soon, and a Cats Effect 2.0 is under discussion.  These will be binary compatible with their 1.x versions, with the exception of their laws modules.  We intend to publish http4s-0.21 on these when they are available in order to provide a compatible stack for our own laws.

    * EOL of 0.18
      This marks the end of active support for the 0.18 series.  Further releases in that series will require a pull request and an accompanying tale of woe.

* Breaking changes
    * [#2506](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2506): Raise `DecodeFailure` with `MonadError` in `Message#as` rather than relying on effect to catch in `fold`. Requires a new `MonadError` constraint.

* Bugfixes
    * [#2502](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2502): Stop relying on undefined behavior of `fold` to catch errors in client.

* Enhancements
    * [#2508](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2508): Add `mediaType` String context macro for validating literals.  Provide the same for `uri` and `qValue`, deprecating `Uri.uri` and `QValue.q`.
    * [#2520](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2520): Parameterize `selectorThreadFactory` for blaze server.  This allows setting the priority for selector threads.

* Documentation
    * [#2488](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2488): Fix bad link in changelog

    * Request rendering and response parsing is now canceled more aggressively on timeout.
    * [#2184](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2184): Receive response concurrently with sending request in blaze client. This reduces waste when the server is not interested in the entire request body.

# v0.19.0-M3 (2018-09-27)

* Breaking changes
    * [#2081](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2081): Remove `OkHttp` code redundant with `OkHttpBuilder`.
    * [#2092](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2092): Remove `ExecutionContext` and `Timer` implicits from async-http-client. Threads are managed by the `ContextShift`.
    * [#2115](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2115): Refactoring of `Server` and `ServerBuilder`:
    * Removed `Server#shutdown`, `Server#shutdownNow`, `Server#onShutdown`, and `Server#awaitShutdown`.  `Server` lifecycles are managed as a `fs2.Stream` or a `cats.effect.Resource`.
    * `ServerBuilder#start` replaced by `Server#resource`, which shuts down the `Server` after use.
    * Added a `ServerBuilder#stream` to construct a `Stream` from a `Resource`.
    * [#2118](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2118): Finalize various case classes.
    * [#2102](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2102): Refactoring of `Client` and some builders:
    * `Client` is no longer a case class.  Construct a new `Client` backend or middleware with `Client.apply(run: Request[F] => Resource[F, Response[F]])` for any `F` with a `Bracket[Throwable, F]`.
    * Removed `DisposableResponse[F]` in favor of `Resource[F, Response[F]]`.
    * Removed `Client#open` in favor of `Client#run`.
    * Removed `Client#shutdown` in favor of `cats.effect.Resource` or `fs2.Stream`.
    * Removed `AsyncHttpClient.apply`. It was not referentially transparent, and no longer possible. Use `AsyncHttpClient.resource` instead.

# v0.19.0-M2 (2018-09-07)

* Breaking changes
    * [#1802](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1802): Race servlet requests against the `AsyncContext.timeout`. `JettyBuilder` and `TomcatBuilder` now require a `ConcurrentEffect` instance.
    * [#1934](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1934): Refactoring of `ConnectionManager`.  Now requires a `Concurrent` instance, which ripples to a `ConcurrentEffect` in blaze-client builders
    * [#2023](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2023): Don't overwrite existing `Vary` headers from `CORS`
    * [#2030](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2023): Restrict `MethodNotAllowed` response generator in DSL
    * [#2032](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2032): Eliminate mutable `Status` registry. IANA-registered `Status`es are still cached, but `register` is no longer public.
    * [#2026](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2026): `CSRF` enhancements
    * CSRF tokens represented with a newtype
    * CSRF token signatures are encoded hexadecimal strings, making them URI-safe.
    * Added a `headerCheck: Request[F] => Boolean` parameter
    * Added an `onFailure: Response[F]` parameter, which defaults to a `403`. This was formerly a hardcoded `401`.
    * [#1993](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2026): Massive changes from cats-effect and fs2 upgrades
    * `Timer` added to `AsyncHttpClient`
    * Dropwizard `Metrics` middleware now takes a `Clock` rather than a `Timer`
    * Client builders renamed and refactored for consistency and to support binary compatible evolution after 1.0:
    *  `BlazeClientBuilder` replaces `Http1Client`, `BlazeClient`, and `BlazeClientConfig`
    *  Removed deprecated `SimpleHttp1Client`
    *  `JavaNetClient` renamed to `JavaNetClientBuilder`, which now has a `resource` and `stream`
    *  `OkHttp` renamed to `OkHttpBuilder`.  The client now created from an `OkHttpClient` instance instead of an `F[OkHttpClient.Builder]`. A default client can be created as a `Resource` through `OkHttp.default`.
    * Fallout from removal of `fs2.Segment`
    *  `EntityDecoder.collectBinary` now decodes a `Chunk`
    *  `EntityDecoder.binaryChunk` deprecated
    *  `SegmentWriter` is removed
    *  Changes to:
      *  `ChunkWriter`s in blaze rewritten
      *  `Logger` middlewares
      *  `MemoryCache`
    * Blocking I/O now requires a blocking `ExecutionContext` and a `ContextShift`:
    *  `EntityDecoder`s:
      *  `EntityDecoder.binFile`
      *  `EntityDecoder.textFile`
      *  `MultipartDecoder.mixedMultipart`
    *  `EntityEncoder`s (no longer implicit):
      *  `File`
      *  `Path`
      *  `InputStream`
      *  `Reader`
    *  Multipart:
      *  `MultipartParser.parseStreamedFile`
      *  `MultipartParser.parseToPartsStreamedFile`
      *  `Part.fileData`
    *  Static resources:
      *  `StaticFile.fromString`
      *  `StaticFile.fromResource`
      *  `StaticFile.fromURL`
      *  `StaticFile.fromFile`
      *  `FileService.Config`
      *  `ResourceService.Config`
      *  `WebjarService.Config`
    *  `OkHttpBuilder`
    *  Servlets:
      *  `BlockingHttp4sServlet`
      *  `BlockingServletIo`
  * Servlet backend changes:
    *  `Http4sServlet` no longer shift onto an `ExecutionContext` by default.  Accordingly, `ServerBuilder` no longer has a `withExecutionContext`.
    *  Jetty and Tomcat builders use their native executor types instead of shifting onto an `ExecutionContext`.  Accordingly, `ServletBuilder#withExecutionContext` is removed.
    *  `AsyncHttp4sServlet` and `ServletContextSyntax` now default to non-blocking I/O.  No startup check is made against the servlet version, which failed classloading on an older servlet container.  Neither takes an `ExeuctionContext` parameter anymore.
  * Removed deprecated `StreamApp` aliases. `fs2.StreamApp` is removed and replaced by `cats.effect.IOApp`, `monix.eval.TaskApp`, or similar.
  * Removed deprecated `ServerApp`.
  * `EntityLimiter` middleware now requires an `ApplicativeError`
  * [#2054](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/2054): blaze-server builder changes
  * `BlazeBuilder` deprecated for `BlazeServerBuilder`
  * `BlazeServerBuidler` has a single `withHttpApp(HttpApp)` in place of zero-to-many calls `mountService(HttpRoutes)`.
    *  This change makes it possible to mount an `HttpApp` wrapped in a `Logger` middleware, which only supports `HttpApp`
    *  Call `.orNotFound`, from `org.http4s.implicits._`, to cap an `HttpRoutes` as `HttpApp`
    *  Use `Router` to combine multiple `HttpRoutes` into a single `HttpRoutes` by prefix
    *  This interface will see more changes before 0.19.0 to promote long-term binary compatibility

* Add `&` extractor to http4s-dsl. [#1758](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1758)
* Deprecate `EntityEncoder[F, Future[A]]`.  The `EntityEncoder` is strict in its argument, which causes any side effect of the `Future` to execute immediately.  Wrap your `future` in `IO.fromFuture(IO(future))` instead. [#1759](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1759)
* Dependency upgrades:

# v0.18.0-M7 (2017-12-23)
* Relax various typeclass constraints from `Effect` to `Sync` or `Async`. [#1587](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1587)
* Operate on `Segment` instead of `Chunk` [#1588](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1588)
   * `EntityDecoder.collectBinary` and `EntityDecoder.binary` now
     return `Segment[Byte, Unit]` instead of `Chunk[Byte]`.

   * Add `EntityEncoder.segmentEncoder`.
   * `http4sMonoidForChunk` replaced by `http4sMonoidForSegment`.
* Add new generators for core RFC 2616 types. [#1593](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1593)
* Undo obsolete copying of bytes in `StaticFile.fromURL`. [#1202](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1202)
* Optimize conversion of `Chunk.Bytes` and `ByteVectorChunk` to `ByteBuffer. [#1602](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1602)
* Rename `read` to `send` and `write` to `receive` in websocket model. [#1603](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1603)
* Remove `MediaRange` mutable `Registry` and add `HttpCodec[MediaRange]` instance [#1597](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1597)
* Remove `Monoid[Segment[A, Unit]]` instance, which is now provided by fs2. [#1609](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1609)
* Introduce `WebSocketBuilder` to build `WebSocket` responses.  Allows headers (e.g., `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`) on a successful handshake, as well as customization of the response to failed handshakes. [#1607](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1607)
* Don't catch exceptions thrown by `EntityDecoder.decodeBy`. Complain loudly in logs about exceptions thrown by `HttpService` rather than raised in `F`. [#1592](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1592)
* Make `abnormal-terminations` and `service-errors` Metrics names plural. [#1611](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1611)
* Refactor blaze client creation. [#1523](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1523)
   * `Http1Client.apply` returns `F[Client[F]]`
   * `Http1Client.stream` returns `Stream[F, Client[F]]`, bracketed to shut down the client.
   * `PooledHttp1Client` constructor is deprecated, replaced by the above.
   * `SimpleHttp1Client` is deprecated with no direct equivalent.  Use `Http1Client`.
* Improve client timeout and wait queue handling
   * `requestTimeout` and `responseHeadersTimeout` begin from the submission of the request.  This includes time spent in the wait queue of the pool. [#1570](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1570)
   * When a connection is `invalidate`d, try to unblock a waiting request under the same key.  Previously, the wait queue would only be checked on recycled connections.
   * When the connection pool is closed, allow connections in the wait queue to complete.
* Changes to Metrics middleware. [#1612](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1612)
   * Decrement the active requests gauge when no request matches
   * Don't count non-matching requests as 4xx in case they're composed with other services.
   * Don't count failed requests as 5xx in case they're recovered elsewhere.  They still get recorded as `service-error`s.
* Dependency upgrades:
   * async-http-client-2.0.38
   * cats-1.0.0.RC2
   * circe-0.9.0-M3

# v0.18.0-M6 (2017-12-08)
* Tested on Java 9.
* `Message.withContentType` now takes a `Content-Type` instead of an
  ``Option[`Content-Type`]``.  `withContentTypeOption` takes an `Option`,
  and `withoutContentType` clears it.
* `QValue` has an `HttpCodec` instance
* `AuthMiddleware` never falls through.  See
  [#1530](https://github.com/http4s/http4s/pull/1530) for more.
* `ContentCoding` is no longer a `Registry`, but has an `HttpCodec`
  instance.
* Render a banner on server startup.  Customize by calling
  `withBanner(List[String])` or `withoutBanner` on the
  `ServerBuilder`.
* Parameterize `isZippable` as a predicate of the `Response` in `GZip`
  middleware.
* Add constant for `application/vnd.api+json` MediaType.
* Limit memory consumption in `GZip` middleware
* Add `handleError`, `handleErrorWith`, `bimap`, `biflatMap`,
  `transform`, and `transformWith` to `EntityDecoder`.
* `org.http4s.util.StreamApp` and `org.http4s.util.ExitCode` are
  deprecated in favor of `fs2.StreamApp` and `fs2.StreamApp.ExitCode`,
  based on what was in http4s.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * fs2-0.10.0-M9
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.6
  * jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M4
  * specs2-4.0.2

# v0.17.6 (2017-12-05)
* Fix `StaticFile` to serve files larger than `Int.MaxValue` bytes
* Dependency upgrades:
  * tomcat-8.5.24

# v0.16.6 (2017-12-04)
* Add a CSRF server middleware
* Fix `NullPointerException` when starting a Tomcat server related to `docBase`
* Log version info and server address on server startup
* Dependency upgrades:
  * jetty-9.4.8.v20171121
  * log4s-1.4.0
  * scalaz-7.2.17
  * twirl-1.3.13

# v0.18.0-M5 (2017-11-02)
* Introduced an `HttpCodec` type class that represents a type that can round
  trip to and from a `String`.  `Uri.Scheme` and `TransferCoding` are the first
  implementors, with more to follow.  Added an `HttpCodecLaws` to http4s-testing.
* `Uri.Scheme` is now its own type instead of a type alias.
* `TransferCoding` is no longer a case class. Its `coding` member is now a
  `String`, not a `CIString`. Its companion is no longer a
  `Registry`.
* Introduced `org.http4s.syntax.literals`, which contains a `StringContext` forAll
  safely constructing a `Uri.Scheme`.  More will follow.
* `org.http4s.util.StreamApp.ExitCode` moved to `org.http4s.util.ExitCode`
* Changed `AuthService[F[_], T]` to `AuthService[T, F[_]]` to support
  partial unification when combining services as a `SemigroupK`.
* Unseal the `MessageFailure` hierarchy. Previous versions of http4s had a
  `GenericParsingFailure`, `GenericDecodeFailure`, and
  `GenericMessageBodyFailure`. This was not compatible with the parameterized
  effect introduced in v0.18. Now, `MessageFailure` is unsealed, so users
  wanting precise control over the default `toHttpResponse` can implement their
  own failure conditions.
* `MessageFailure` now has an `Option[Throwable]` cause.
* Removed `KleisliInstances`. The `SemigroupK[Kleisli[F, A, ?]]` is now provided
  by cats.  Users should no longer need to import `org.http4s.implicits._` to
  get `<+>` composition of `HttpService`s
* `NonEmptyList` extensions moved from `org.http4s.util.nonEmptyList` to
  `org.http4s.syntax.nonEmptyList`.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * cats-1.0.0-RC1
  * fs2-0.10.0-M8
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.5

# v0.18.0-M4 (2017-10-12)
* Syntax for building requests moved from `org.http4s.client._` to
  `org.http4s.client.dsl.Http4sClientDsl[F]`, with concrete type `IO`
  available as `org.http4s.client.dsl.io._`.  This is consistent with
  http4s-dsl for servers.
* Change `StreamApp` to return a `Stream[F, ExitCode]`. The first exit code
  returned by the stream is the exit code of the JVM. This allows custom exit
  codes, and eases dead code warnings in certain constructions that involved
  mapping over `Nothing`.
* `AuthMiddleware.apply` now takes an `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], T]`
  instead of a `Kleisli[F, Request[F], T]`.
* Set `Content-Type` header on default `NotFound` response.
* Merges from v0.16.5 and v0.17.5.
* Remove mutable map that backs `Method` registry. All methods in the IANA
  registry are available through `Method.all`. Custom methods should be memoized
  by other means.
* Adds an `EntityDecoder[F, Array[Byte]]` and `EntityDecoder[F, Array[Char]]`
  for symmetry with provided `EntityEncoder` instances.
* Adds `Arbitrary` instances for `Headers`, `EntityBody[F]` (currently just
  single chunk), `Entity[F]`, and `EntityEncoder[F, A]`.
* Adds `EntityEncoderLaws` for `EntityEncoder`.
* Adds `EntityCodecLaws`.  "EntityCodec" is not a type in http4s, but these
  laws relate an `EntityEncoder[F, A]` to an `EntityDecoder[F, A]`.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.5 (2017-10-12)
* Merges only.

# v0.16.5 (2017-10-11)
* Correctly implement sanitization of dot segments in static file paths
  according to RFC 3986 5.2.4. Most importantly, this fixes an issue where `...`
  is reinterpreted as `..` and can escape the root of the static file service.

# v0.18.0-M3 (2017-10-04)
* Merges only.
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.4 (2017-10-04)
* Fix reading of request body in non-blocking servlet backend. It was previously
  only reading the first byte of each chunk.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * fs2-reactive-streams-0.1.1

# v0.16.4 (2017-10-04)
* Backport removal `java.xml.bind` dependency from `GZip` middleware,
  to play more nicely with Java 9.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * metrics-core-3.2.5
  * tomcat-8.0.23
  * twirl-1.3.12

# v0.18.0-M2 (2017-10-03)
* Use http4s-dsl with any effect type by either:
    *  extend `Http4sDsl[F]`
    *  create an object that extends `Http4sDsl[F]`, and extend that.
    *  `import org.http4s.dsl.io._` is still available for those who
      wish to specialize on `cats.effect.IO`
* Remove `Semigroup[F[MaybeResponse[F]]]` constraint from
  `BlazeBuilder`.
* Fix `AutoSlash` middleware when a service is mounted with a prefix.
* Publish internal http4s-parboiled2 as a separate module.  This does
  not add any new third-party dependencies, but unbreaks `sbt
  publishLocal`.
* Add `Request.from`, which respects `X-Fowarded-For` header.
* Make `F` in `EffectMessageSyntax` invariant
* Add `message.decodeJson[A]` syntax to replace awkward `message.as(implicitly,
  jsonOf[A])`. Brought into scope by importing one of the following, based on
  your JSON library of choice.
  * `import org.http4s.argonaut._`
  * `import org.http4s.circe._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.jackson._`
  * `import org.http4s.json4s.native._`
* `AsyncHttpClient.apply` no longer takes a `bufferSize`.  It is made
  irrelevant by fs2-reactive-streams.
* `MultipartParser.parse` no longer takes a `headerLimit`, which was unused.
* Add `maxWaitQueueLimit` (default 256) and `maxConnectionsPerRequestKey`
  (default 10) to `PooledHttp1Client`.
* Remove private implicit `ExecutionContext` from `StreamApp`. This had been
  known to cause diverging implicit resolution that was hard to debug.
* Shift execution of the routing of the `HttpService` to the `ExecutionContext`
  provided by the `JettyBuilder` or `TomcatBuilder`. Previously, it only shifted
  the response task and stream. This was a regression from v0.16.
* Add two utility execution contexts. These may be used to increase throughput
  as the server builder's `ExecutionContext`. Blocking calls on routing may
  decrease fairness or even deadlock your service, so use at your own risk:
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.direct`
  * `org.http4s.util.execution.trampoline`
* Deprecate `EffectRequestSyntax` and `EffectResponseSyntax`. These were
  previously used to provide methods such as `.putHeaders` and `.withBody`
  on types `F[Request]` and `F[Response]`.  As an alternative:
  * Call `.map` or `.flatMap` on `F[Request]` and `F[Response]` to get access
    to all the same methods.
  * Variadic headers have been added to all the status code generators in
    `Http4sDsl[F]` and method generators in `import org.http4s.client._`.
    For example:
    *  `POST(uri, urlForm, Header("Authorization", "Bearer s3cr3t"))`
    *  ``Ok("This will have an html content type!", `Content-Type`(`text/html`))``
* Restate `HttpService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], Request[F], Response[F]]`.
* Similarly, `AuthedService[F]` as a `Kleisli[OptionT[F, ?], AuthedRequest[F], Response[F]]`.
* `MaybeResponse` is removed, because the optionality is now expressed through
  the `OptionT` in `HttpService`. Instead of composing `HttpService` via a
  `Semigroup`, compose via a `SemigroupK`. Import `org.http4s.implicits._` to
  get a `SemigroupK[HttpService]`, and chain services as `s1 <+> s2`. We hope to
  remove the need for `org.http4s.implicits._` in a future version of cats with
  [issue 1428](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/1428).
* The `Service` type alias is deprecated in favor of `Kleisli`.  It used to represent
  a partial application of the first type parameter, but since version 0.18, it is
  identical to `Kleisli.
* `HttpService.lift`, `AuthedService.lift` are deprecated in favor of `Kleisli.apply`.
* Remove `java.xml.bind` dependency from `GZip` middleware to avoid an
  extra module dependency in Java 9.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    *  jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M2
    *  log4s-1.4.0
* There is a classpath difference in log4s version between blaze and http4s in this
  milestone that will be remedied in M6. We believe these warnings are safe.

# v0.17.3 (2017-10-02)
* Shift execution of HttpService to the `ExecutionContext` provided by the
  `BlazeBuilder` when using HTTP/2. Previously, it only shifted the response
  task and body stream.

# v0.16.3 (2017-09-29)
* Fix `java.io.IOException: An invalid argument was supplied` on blaze-client
  for Windows when writing an empty sequence of `ByteBuffer`s.
* Set encoding of `captureWriter` to UTF-8 instead of the platform default.
* Dependency upgrades:
  * blaze-0.12.9

# v0.17.2 (2017-09-25)
* Remove private implicit strategy from `StreamApp`. This had been known to
  cause diverging implicit resolution that was hard to debug.
* Shift execution of HttpService to the `ExecutionContext` provided by the
  `BlazeBuilder`. Previously, it only shifted the response stream. This was a
  regression from 0.16.
* Split off http4s-parboiled2 module as `"org.http4s" %% "parboiled"`. There are
  no externally visible changes, but this simplifies and speeds the http4s
  build.

# v0.16.2 (2017-09-25)
* Dependency patch upgrades:
  * async-http-client-2.0.37
  * blaze-0.12.8: changes default number of selector threads to
    from `2 * cores + 1` to `max(4, cores + 1)`.
  * jetty-9.4.7.v20170914
  * tomcat-8.5.21
  * twirl-1.3.7

# v0.17.1 (2017-09-17)
* Fix bug where metrics were not captured in `Metrics` middleware.
* Pass `redactHeadersWhen` argument from `Logger` to `RequestLogger`
  and `ResponseLogger`.

# v0.16.1 (2017-09-17)
* Publish our fork of parboiled2 as http4s-parboiled2 module.  It's
  the exact same internal code as was in http4s-core, with no external
  dependencies. By publishing an extra module, we enable a
  `publishLocal` workflow.
* Charset fixes:
  * Deprecate `CharsetRange.isSatisfiedBy` in favor of
    and ```Accept-Charset`.isSatisfiedBy`` in favor of
    ```Accept-Charset`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    ```Charset`.*``.
  * Add `CharsetRange.matches`.
* ContentCoding fixes:
  * Deprecate `ContentCoding.satisfiedBy` and
    `ContentCoding.satisfies` in favor of ```Accept-Encoding`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Deprecate ```Accept-Encoding`.preferred``, which has no reasonable
    interpretation in the presence of splats.
  * Add ```Accept-Language`.qValue``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    `ContentCoding.*`.
  * Add `ContentCoding.matches` and `ContentCoding.registered`.
  * Add `Arbitrary[ContentCoding]` and ```Arbitrary[`Accept-Encoding`]``
    instances.
* LanguageTag fixes:
  * Deprecate `LanguageTag.satisfiedBy` and
    `LanguageTag.satisfies` in favor of ```Accept-Language`.satisfiedBy``.
  * Fix definition of `satisfiedBy` to respect priority of
    `LanguageTag.*` and matches of a partial set of subtags.
  * Add `LanguageTag.matches`.
  * Deprecate `LanguageTag.withQuality` in favor of new
    `LanguageTag.withQValue`.
  * Deprecate ```Accept-Language`.preferred``, which has no reasonable
    interpretation in the presence of splats.
  * Add ```Accept-Language`.qValue``.
  * Add `Arbitrary[LanguageTag]` and ```Arbitrary[`Accept-Language`]``
    instances.

# v0.17.0 (2017-09-01)
* Honor `Retry-After` header in `Retry` middleware.  The response will
  not be retried until the maximum of the backoff strategy and any
  time specified by the `Retry-After` header of the response.
* The `RetryPolicy.defaultRetriable` only works for methods guaranteed
  to not have a body.  In fs2, we can't introspect the stream to
  guarantee that it can be rerun.  To retry requests for idempotent
  request methods, use `RetryPolicy.unsafeRetriable`.  To retry
  requests regardless of method, use
  `RetryPolicy.recklesslyRetriable`.
* Fix `Logger` middleware to render JSON bodies as text, not as a hex
  dump.
* `MultipartParser.parse` returns a stream of `ByteVector` instead of
  a stream of `Byte`. This perserves chunking when parsing into the
  high-level `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`, and substantially improves
  performance on large files.  The high-level API is not affected.

# v0.16.0 (2017-09-01)
* `Retry` middleware takes a `RetryPolicy` instead of a backoff
  strategy.  A `RetryPolicy` is a function of the request, the
  response, and the number of attempts.  Wrap the previous `backoff`
  in `RetryPolicy {}` for compatible behavior.
* Expose a `Part.fileData` constructor that accepts an `EntityBody`.

# v0.17.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* In blaze-server, when doing chunked transfer encoding, flush the
  header as soon as it is available.  It previously buffered until the
  first chunk was available.

# v0.16.0-RC3 (2017-08-29)
* Add a `responseHeaderTimeout` property to `BlazeClientConfig`.  This
  measures the time between the completion of writing the request body
  to the reception of a complete response header.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    *  async-http-client-2.0.35

# v0.18.0-M1 (2017-08-24)

This release is the product of a long period of parallel development
across different foundation libraries, making a detailed changelog
difficult.  This is a living document, so if any important points are
missed here, please send a PR.

The most important change in http4s-0.18 is that the effect type is
parameterized.  Where previous versions were specialized on
`scalaz.concurrent.Task` or `fs2.Task`, this version supports anything
with a `cats.effect.Effect` instance.  The easiest way to port an
existing service is to replace your `Task` with `cats.effect.IO`,
which has a similar API and is already available on your classpath.
If you prefer to bring your own effect, such as `monix.eval.Task` or
stick to `scalaz.concurrent.Task` or put a transformer on `IO`, that's
fine, too!

The parameterization chanages many core signatures throughout http4s:
- `Request` and `Response` become `Request[F[_]]` and
  `Response[F[_]]`.  The `F` is the effect type of the body (i.e.,
  `Stream[F, Byte]`), or what the body `.run`s to.
- `HttpService` becomes `HttpService[F[_]]`, so that the service
  returns an `F[Response[F]]`.  Instead of constructing with
  `HttpService { ... }`, we now declare the effect type of the
  service, like `HttpService[IO] { ... }`.  This determines the type
  of request and response handled by the service.
- `EntityEncoder[A]` and `EntityDecoder[A]` are now
  `EntityEncoder[F[_], A]` and `EntityDecoder[F[_], A]`, respectively.
  These act as a codec for `Request[F]` and `Response[F]`.  In practice,
  this change tends to be transparent in the DSL.
- The server builders now take an `F` parameter, which needs to match
  the services mounted to them.
- The client now takes an `F` parameter, which determines the requests
  and responses it handles.

Several dependencies are upgraded:
- cats-1.0.0.MF
- circe-0.9.0-M1
- fs2-0.10.0-M6
- fs2-reactive-streams-0.2.2
- jawn-fs2-0.12.0-M1

# v0.17.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Remove `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound(a: A): Task[Response]` in favor of
  `ServiceSyntax.orNotFound: Service[Request, Response]`

# v0.16.0-RC2 (2017-08-24)
* Move http4s-blaze-core from `org.http4s.blaze` to
  `org.http4s.blazecore` to avoid a conflict with the non-http4s
  blaze-core module.
* Change `ServiceOps` to operate on a `Service[?, MaybeResponse]`.
  Give it an `orNotFound` that returns a `Service`.  The
  `orNotFound(a: A)` overload is left for compatibility with Scala
  2.10.
* Build with Lightbend compiler instead of Typelevel compiler so we
  don't expose `org.typelevel` dependencies that are incompatible with
  ntheir counterparts in `org.scala-lang`.
* Upgraded dependencies:
    *  blaze-0.12.7 (fixes eviction notice in http4s-websocket)
    *  twirl-1.3.4

# v0.17.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Port `ChunkAggregator` to fs2
* Add logging middleware
* Standardize on `ExecutionContext` over `Strategy` and `ExecutorService`
* Implement `Age` header
* Fix `Client#toHttpService` to not dispose until the body is consumed
* Add a buffered implementation of `EntityDecoder[Multipart]`
* In async-http-client, don't use `ReactiveStreamsBodyGenerator` unless there is
  a body to transmit. This fixes an `IllegalStateException: unexpected message
  type`
* Add `HSTS` middleware
* Add option to serve pre-gzipped resources
* Add RequestLogging and ResponseLogging middlewares
* `StaticFile` options return `OptionT[Task, ?]`
* Set `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header when serving
  from a URL
* Explicitly close `URLConnection``s if we are not reading the contents
* Upgrade to:
    *  async-http-client-2.0.34
    *  fs2-0.9.7
    *  metrics-core-3.2.4
    *  scodec-bits-1.1.5

# v0.16.0-RC1 (2017-08-16)
* Remove laziness from `ArbitraryInstances`
* Support an arbitrary predicate for CORS allowed origins
* Support `Access-Control-Expose-Headers` header for CORS
* Fix thread safety issue in `EntityDecoder[XML]`
* Support IPV6 headers in `X-Forwarded-For`
* Add `status` and `successful` methods to client
* Overload `client.fetchAs` and `client.streaming` to accept a `Task[Request]`
* Replace `Instant` with `HttpDate` to avoid silent truncation and constrain
  to dates that are legally renderable in HTTP.
* Fix bug in hash code of `CIString`
* Update `request.pathInfo` when changing `request.withUri`. To keep these
  values in sync, `request.copy` has been deprecated, but copy constructors
  based on `with` have been added.
* Remove `name` from `AttributeKey`.
* Add `withFragment` and `withoutFragment` to `Uri`
* Construct `Content-Length` with `fromLong` to ensure validity, and
  `unsafeFromLong` when you can assert that it's positive.
* Add missing instances to `QueryParamDecoder` and `QueryParamEncoder`.
* Add `response.cookies` method to get a list of cookies from `Set-Cookie`
  header.  `Set-Cookie` is no longer a `Header.Extractable`, as it does
  not adhere to the HTTP spec of being concatenable by commas without
  changing semantics.
* Make servlet `HttpSession` available as a request attribute in servlet
  backends
* Fix `Part.name` to return the name from the `Content-Disposition` header
  instead of the name _of_ the `Content-Disposition` header. Accordingly, it is
  no longer a `CIString`
* `Request.toString` and `Response.toString` now redact sensitive headers. A
  method to redact arbitrary headers is added to `Headers`.
* `Retry-After` is now modeled as a `Either[HttpDate, Long]` to reflect either
  an http-date or delta-seconds value.
* Look for index.html in `StaticFile` when rendering a directory instead of
  returning `401 Unauthorized`.
* Limit dates to a minimum of January 1, 1900, per RFC.
* Add `serviceErrorHandler` to `ServerBuilder` to allow pluggable error handlers
  when a server backend receives a failed task or a thrown Exception when
  invoking a service. The default calls `toHttpResponse` on `MessageFailure` and
  closes the connection with a `500 InternalServerError` on other non-fatal
  errors.  Fatal errors are left to the server.
* `FollowRedirect` does not propagate sensitive headers when redirecting to a
  different authority.
* Add Content-Length header to empty response generators
* Upgraded dependencies:
    *  async-http-client-2.0.34
    *  http4s-websocket-0.2.0
    *  jetty-9.4.6.v20170531
    *  json4s-3.5.3
    *  log4s-1.3.6
    *  metrics-core-3.2.3
    *  scala-2.12.3-bin-typelevel-4
    *  scalaz-7.2.15
    *  tomcat-8.5.20

# v0.15.16 (2017-07-20)
* Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`

# ~~v0.15.15 (2017-07-20)~~
* Oops. Same as v0.15.14.

# v0.15.14 (2017-07-10)
* Close parens in `Request.toString`
* Use "message" instead of "request" in message body failure messages
* Add `problem+json` media type
* Tolerate `[` and `]` in queries parsing URIs. These characters are parsed, but
  percent-encoded.

# v0.17.0-M3 (2017-05-27)
* Fix file corruption issue when serving static files from the classpath

# v0.16.0-M3 (2017-05-25)
* Fix `WebjarService` so it matches assets.
* `ServerApp` overrides `process` to leave a single abstract method
* Add gzip trailer in `GZip` middleware
* Upgraded dependencies:
    *  circe-0.8.0
    *  jetty-9.4.5.v20170502
    *  scalaz-7.2.13
    *  tomcat-8.5.15
* `ProcessApp` uses a `Process[Task, Nothing]` rather than a
  `Process[Task, Unit]`
* `Credentials` is split into `Credentials.AuthParams` for key-value pairs and
  `Credentials.Token` for legacy token-based schemes.  `OAuthBearerToken` is
  subsumed by `Credentials.Token`.  `BasicCredentials` no longer extends
  `Credentials`, but is extractable from one.  This model permits the
  definition of other arbitrary credential schemes.
* Add `fromSeq` constructor to `UrlForm`
* Allow `WebjarService` to pass on methods other than `GET`.  It previously
  threw a `MatchError`.

# v0.15.13 (2017-05-25)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
    *  async-http-client-2.0.32
    *  blaze-0.12.6 (fixes infinite loop in some SSL handshakes)
    *  jetty-9.3.19.v20170502
    *  json4s-3.5.2
    *  tomcat-8.0.44

# v0.15.12 (2017-05-11)
* Fix GZip middleware to render a correct stream

# v0.17.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* `Timeout` middleware takes an implicit `Scheduler` and
  `ExecutionContext`
* Bring back `http4s-async-client`, based on `fs2-reactive-stream`
* Restore support for WebSockets

# v0.16.0-M2 (2017-04-30)
* Upgraded dependencies:
    *  argonaut-6.2
    *  jetty-9.4.4.v20170414
    *  tomcat-8.5.14
* Fix `ProcessApp` to terminate on process errors
* Set `secure` request attribute correctly in blaze server
* Exit with code `-1` when `ProcessApp` fails
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Rename `ProcessApp.main` to `ProcessApp.process` to avoid overload confusio
* Avoid intermediate String allocation in Circe's `jsonEncoder`
* Adaptive `EntityDecoder[Json]` for circe: works directly from a ByteBuffer for
  small bodies, and incrementally through jawn for larger.
* Capture more context in detail message of parse errors

# v0.15.11 (2017-04-29)
* Upgrade to blaze-0.12.5 to pick up fix for `StackOverflowError` in
  SSL handshake

# v0.15.10 (2017-04-28)
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies
* argonaut-6.2
* scalaz-7.2.12
* Allow preambles and epilogues in multipart bodies
* Limit multipart headers to 40 kilobytes to avoid unbounded buffering
  of long lines in a header
* Remove `' '` and `'?'` from alphabet for generated multipart
  boundaries, as these are not token characters and are known to cause
  trouble for some multipart implementations
* Fix multipart parsing for unlucky input chunk sizes

# v0.15.9 (2017-04-19)
* Terminate `ServerApp` even if the server fails to start
* Make `ResourceService` respect `If-Modified-Since`
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
* async-http-client-2.0.31
* jetty-9.3.18.v20170406
* json4s-3.5.1
* log4s-1.3.4
* metrics-core-3.1.4
* scalacheck-1.13.5
* scalaz-7.1.13 or scalaz-7.2.11
* tomcat-8.0.43

# v0.17.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* First release on cats and fs2
    *  All scalaz types and typeclasses replaced by cats equivalengts
	* `scalaz.concurrent.Task` replaced by `fs2.Task`
	* `scalaz.stream.Process` replaced by `fs2.Stream`
* Roughly at feature parity with v0.16.0-M1. Notable exceptions:
	* Multipart not yet supported
	* Web sockets not yet supported
	* Client retry middleware can't check idempotence of requests
	* Utilties in `org.http4s.util.io` not yet ported

# v0.16.0-M1 (2017-04-08)
* Fix type of `AuthedService.empty`
* Eliminate `Fallthrough` typeclass.  An `HttpService` now returns
  `MaybeResponse`, which can be a `Response` or `Pass`.  There is a
  `Semigroup[MaybeResponse]` instance that allows `HttpService`s to be
  chained as a semigroup.  `service orElse anotherService` is
  deprecated in favor of `service |+| anotherService`.
* Support configuring blaze and Jetty servers with a custom
  `SSLContext`.
* Upgraded dependencies for various modules:
    *  async-http-client-2.0.31
    *  circe-0.7.1
    *  jetty-9.4.3.v20170317
    *  json4s-3.5.1
    *  logback-1.2.1
    *  log4s-1.3.4
    *  metrics-3.2.0
    *  scalacheck-1.13.5
    *  tomcat-8.0.43
* Deprecate `EntityEncoder[ByteBuffer]` and
  `EntityEncoder[CharBuffer]`.
* Add `EntityDecoder[Unit]`.
* Move `ResponseClass`es into `Status`.
* Use `SSLContext.getDefault` by default in blaze-client.  Use
  `BlazeServerConfig.insecure` to ignore certificate validity.  But
  please don't.
* Move `CIString` syntax to `org.http4s.syntax`.
* Bundle an internal version of parboiled2.  This decouples core from
  shapeless, allowing applications to use their preferred version of
  shapeless.
* Rename `endpointAuthentication` to `checkEndpointAuthentication`.
* Add a `WebjarService` for serving files out of web jars.
* Implement `Retry-After` header.
* Stop building with `delambdafy` on Scala 2.11.
* Eliminate finalizer on `BlazeConnection`.
* Respond OK to CORS pre-flight requests even if the wrapped service
  does not return a successful response.  This is to allow `CORS`
  pre-flight checks of authenticated services.
* Deprecate `ServerApp` in favor of `org.http4s.util.ProcessApp`.  A
  `ProcessApp` is easier to compose all the resources a server needs via
  `Process.bracket`.
* Implement a `Referer` header.

# v0.15.8 (2017-04-06)
* Cache charset lookups to avoid synchronization.  Resolution of
  charsets is synchronized, with a cache size of two.  This avoids
  the synchronized call on the HTTP pool.
* Strip fragment from request target in blaze-client.  An HTTP request
  target should not include the fragment, and certain servers respond
  with a `400 Bad Request` in their presence.

# v0.15.7 (2017-03-09)
* Change default server and client executors to a minimum of four
  threads.
* Bring scofflaw async-http-client to justice for its brazen
  violations of Reactive Streams Rule 3.16, requesting of a null
  subscription.
* Destroy Tomcat instances after stopping, so they don't hold the port
* Deprecate `ArbitraryInstances.genCharsetRangeNoQuality`, which can
  cause deadlocks
* Patch-level upgrades to dependencies:
    *  async-http-client-2.0.30
    *  jetty-9.3.16.v20170120
    *  logback-1.1.11
    *  metrics-3.1.3
    *  scala-xml-1.0.6
    *  scalaz-7.2.9
    *  tomcat-8.0.41
    *  twirl-1.2.1

# v0.15.6 (2017-03-03)
* Log unhandled MessageFailures to `org.http4s.server.message-failures`

# v0.15.5 (2017-02-20)
* Allow services wrapped in CORS middleware to fall through
* Don't log message about invalid CORS headers when no `Origin` header present
* Soften log about invalid CORS headers from info to debug

# v0.15.4 (2017-02-12)
* Call `toHttpResponse` on tasks failed with `MessageFailure`s from
  `HttpService`, to get proper 4xx handling instead of an internal
  server error.

# v0.15.3 (2017-01-17)
* Dispose of redirect responses in `FollowRedirect`. Fixes client deadlock under heavy load
* Refrain from logging headers with potentially sensitive info in blaze-client
* Add `hashCode` and `equals` to `Headers`
* Make `challenge` in auth middlewares public to facilitate composing multiple auth mechanisms
* Fix blaze-client detection of stale connections

# v0.15.2 (2016-12-29)
* Add helpers to add cookies to requests

# v0.12.6 (2016-12-29)
* Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`

# ~~v0.12.5 (2016-12-29)~~
* ~~Backport rendering of details in `ParseFailure.getMessage`~~ Oops.

# v0.15.1 (2016-12-20)
* Fix GZip middleware to fallthrough non-matching responses
* Fix UnsupportedOperationException in `Arbitrary[Uri]`
* Upgrade to Scala 2.12.1 and Scalaz 7.2.8

# v0.15.0 (2016-11-30)

* Make all case classes final where possible, sealed where not.
* Codec for Server Sent Events (SSE)
* Added JSONP middleware
* Improve Expires header to more easily build the header and support parsing of the header
* Replce lazy `Raw.parsed` field with a simple null check
* Added support for Zipkin headers
* Eliminate response attribute for detecting fallthrough response.
  The fallthrough response must be `Response.fallthrough`.
* Encode URI path segments created with `/`
* Introduce `AuthedRequest` and `AuthedService` types.
* Replace `CharSequenceEncoder` with `CharBufferEncoder`, assuming
  that `CharBuffer` and `String` are the only `CharSequence`s one
  would want to encode.
* Remove `EnittyEncoder[Char]` and `EntityEncoder[Byte]`.  Send an
  array, buffer, or String if you want this.
* Add `DefaultHead` middleware for `HEAD` implementation.
* Decouple `http4s-server` from Dropwizard Metrics.  Metrics code is
  in the new `http4s-metrics` module.
* Allow custom scheduler for timeout middleware.
* Add parametric empty `EntityEncoder` and `EntityEncoder[Unit]`.
* Replace unlawful `Order[CharsetRange]` with `Equal[CharsetRange]`.
* Auth middlewares renamed `BasicAuth` and `DigestAuth`.
* `BasicAuth` passes client password to store instead of requesting
  password from store.
* Remove realm as an argument to the basic and digest auth stores.
* Basic and digest auth stores return a parameterized type instead of
  just a String username.
* Upgrade to argonaut-6.2-RC2, circe-0.6.1, json4s-3.5.0

# v0.14.11 (2016-10-25)
* Fix expansion of `uri` and `q` macros by qualifying with `_root_`

# v0.14.10 (2016-10-12)

* Upgrade to Jetty 9.3.12
* Upgrade to Tomcat 8.0.37

# v0.14.7 (2016-09-25)
* Retry middleware now only retries requests with idempotent methods
  and pure bodies and appropriate status codes
* Fix bug where redirects followed when an effectful chunk (i.e., `Await`) follows pure ones.
* Don't uppercase two hex digits after "%25" when percent encoding.
* Tolerate invalid percent-encodings when decoding.
* Omit scoverage dependencies from POM

# v0.14.6 (2016-09-11)

  termination in metrics

# v0.14.5 (2016-09-02)
* Fix blaze-client handling of HEAD requests

# v0.14.4 (2016-08-29)
* Don't render trailing "/" for URIs with empty paths
* Avoid calling tail of empty list in `/:` extractor

# v0.14.3 (2016-08-24)
* Follow 301 and 302 responses to POST with a GET request.
* Follow all redirect responses to HEAD with a HEAD request.
* Fix bug where redirect response is disposed prematurely even if not followed.
* Fix bug where payload headers are sent from original request when
  following a redirect with a GET or HEAD.
* Return a failed task instead of throwing when a client callback
  throws an exception. Fixes a resource leak.
* Always render `Date` header in GMT.
* Fully support the three date formats specified by RFC 7231.
* Always specify peer information in blaze-client SSL engines
* Patch upgrades to latest async-http-client, jetty, scalaz, and scalaz-stream

# v0.14.2 (2016-08-10)
