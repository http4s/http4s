# Integrations

Http4s provides a standard interface for defining services and clients. This enables an ecosystem of interchangeable server and client backends.

There are also integrations for entities, metrics, and more. Check out the "Related Projects" section of the navigation menu for the complete list of integrations.

## Ember

Http4s Ember is a server and client backend developed in the core repository.

- Implements HTTP/1 and HTTP/2
- Runs on JDK 8+, Node.js 16+, and Scala Native
- Pure FP, built with Cats Effect and FS2

```scala

  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-ember-server" % "@VERSION@",
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-ember-client" % "@VERSION@",
)
```
