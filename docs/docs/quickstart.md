# Quick Start

## Dependencies

http4s is available for Scala 2.12, 2.13, and 3.2+. You can add http4s to your build by adding its modules to `libraryDependencies` in your `build.sbt`.

```scala
val http4sVersion = "@VERSION@"

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-ember-client" % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-ember-server" % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-dsl"          % http4sVersion,
)
```

This brings in the [Ember HTTP client and server implementation][ember] as well as the [routing DSL][dsl]. This is _most likely_ what you want. Other [integration modules][integrations] are available as well, such as for working with [JSON], or using alternative client/server implementations, such as [Netty]. Note that these integration modules are generally versioned separately from http4s core; check their documentation for compatibility information.

Depending on your usecase, you may want to consider one of several other http4s modules. For example, if you are writing a library, you probably want to develop it against the generic http4s interfaces, without hard-coding a particular implementation, such as Ember.

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-core"         % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-client"       % http4sVersion,
  "org.http4s" %% "http4s-server"       % http4sVersion,
)
```

@:callout(info)
To run with 2.12 please make sure that the flag `-Ypartial-unification`
is enabled in your compiler options (i.e `scalacOptions += "-Ypartial-unification"` in sbt).
This feature is enabled by default starting in Scala 2.13.

## Giter8 Template

Getting started with http4s is easy.  Let's materialize an http4s
skeleton project from its [giter8 template]:

```sbt
# for Scala 2.x
$ sbt new http4s/http4s.g8 --branch 0.23

# for Scala 3
$ sbt new http4s/http4s.g8 --branch 0.23-scala3
```

Follow the prompts.  For every step along the way, a default value is
provided in brackets.

`name`
: name of your project.

`organization`
: the organization you publish under.  It's common practice on the JVM
to make this a domain you own, in reverse order (i.e., TLD first).
`io.github.username` is also a fine choice.

`package`
: by default, your organization followed by the project name.

`sbt_version`
: the version of SBT for your generated project.

`scala_version`
: the version of Scala for your generated project.

`http4s_version`
: defaults to the latest stable release of http4s.  See
  the [versions] page for other suggestions.

`logback_version`
: the version of Logback for logging in your generated project.

At the end of the process, you'll see:

```
Template applied in ./quickstart
```

In addition to sbt build machinery, some Scala source files are
generated:

```sh
$ cd quickstart
$ find src/main -name '*.scala'
./src/main/scala/com/example/quickstart/HelloWorld.scala
./src/main/scala/com/example/quickstart/QuickstartRoutes.scala
./src/main/scala/com/example/quickstart/Jokes.scala
./src/main/scala/com/example/quickstart/Main.scala
./src/main/scala/com/example/quickstart/QuickstartServer.scala
```
`Main.scala` defines a runnable object `Main extends IOApp` with an entry point method `run`
which calls the `stream` method of the object `QuickstartServer` defined on `QuickstartServer.scala`.
Starting ember, http4s' native server backend.

`QuickStartRoutes` has two `route` definitions. The `helloWorldRoutes` containing a simple `HttpRoutes`
that responds to `GET/hello/$USERNAME` with a JSON greeting.  Let's try it:

```sh
$ sbt run
```

Depending on the state of your Ivy cache, several dependencies will
download.  This is a good time to grab a beverage.  When you come
back, you should see a line similar to this:

```
[io-compute-1] INFO  o.h.e.s.EmberServerBuilderCompanionPlatform - Ember-Server service bound to address: [::]:8080
```

This indicates that ember is running our service on port 8080. Let's try out the
hello world service with curl:

```sh
$ curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello/world
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Sun, 28 Jun 2020 16:23:31 GMT
Content-Length: 26

{"message":"Hello, world"}
```

To shut down your server, simply press `^C` in your console. Note that
when running interactive SBT, `^C` will kill the SBT process. For rapid
application development, you may wish to add the [sbt-revolver] plugin
to your project and starting the server from the SBT prompt with `reStart`.

With just a few commands, we have a fully functional app for creating
a simple JSON service.
