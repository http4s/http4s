  /** Creates an EntityDecoder for `multipart/form-data` bodies, using
    * the given `MultipartReceiver` to decide how to handle each Part.
    *
    * The creation of the EntityDecoder happens as a Resource which,
    * when release, will release any underlying Resources that may
    * have been allocated during the decoding process (e.g. temp files
    * used for buffering Part bodies). Since the underlying Resources
    * will not be released until this Resource is released, it is not
    * recommended to reuse the allocated EntityDecoder.
    *
    * The `MultipartReceiver` is responsible for deciding the decoding
    * logic for each Part, on a case-by-case basis. Some `MultipartReceiver`s
    * are uniform, processing each part the same way. Others may be fully
    * custom, processing each part in a different way. See the [[PartReceiver]]
    * companion for examples.
    *
    * This allows the decoder to avoid unnecessary work in many cases.
    * For example, a MultipartReceiver can be defined to only expect
    * a specific set of parts, such that a request containing a data
    * in unexpected parts would cause decoding to halt with an error,
    * rather than continuing to read each part and potentially write
    * their data to buffers.
    *
    * This also allows for an explicit choice of how each part is
    * buffered, if at all. As opposed to [[mixedMultipartResource]],
    * which buffers Part bodies opaquely and exposes them as a
    * `Stream[F, Byte]`, a `MultipartReceiver` can make explicit choices
    * about the destination of, and representation of, its Part bodies.
    *
    * Furthermore, since each `Part` is subject to decoding as it is
    * encountered (i.e. before any potential buffering), when the decoding
    * of a Part fails, the overall decoding process can halt early, without
    * bothering to pull the rest of the stream.
    *
    * @param recv A MultipartReceiver which dictates that decoding logic for each Part
    * @param headerLimit Maximum acceptable size of any Part's headers
    * @param maxParts Maximum acceptable number of parts
    * @param failOnLimit If `true`, exceeding the `maxParts` will cause a decoding failure.
    *                    If `false`, any parts beyond the limit will be ignored.
    * @return A resource which allocates an EntityDecoder for `multipart/form-data`
    *         media and releases any resources allocated by that decoder.
