        /* Note that this use of a queue is not typical of http4s applications.
         * This creates a single queue to connect the input and output activity
         * on the WebSocket together. The queue is therefore not accessible outside
         * of the scope of this single HTTP request to connect a WebSocket.
         *
         * While this meets the contract of the service to echo traffic back to
         * its source, many applications will want to create the queue object at
         * a higher level and pass it into the "routes" method or the containing
         * class constructor in order to share the queue (or some other concurrency
         * object) across multiple requests, or to scope it to the application itself
         * instead of to a request.
